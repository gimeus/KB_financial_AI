For money exchange and transfer abroad, the text explains the concept of exchange rates, methods to check these rates, and ways to exchange money.

The text discusses methods of sending money via personalized money transfer services and fintech for small-sum international transactions. It further discusses how to prevent financial fraud from various forms such as phishing, where voice and messenger phishing are mentioned in particular. It points out the need for foreigners to be cautious and not participate in the withdrawal of funds from voice phishing. The document also covers internet-based fraud like pharming and smishing, offering prevention tips for each. Furthermore, it touches on loan fraud, financial fraud involving illegally obtained bank accounts, and insurance fraud, providing characteristics and prevention strategies for each.

The text appears to be an outline or table of contents for a guide on using banking services, particularly for foreign residents in Korea. It covers subjects like preventing insurance fraud, lists of bank branches offering services for foreign residents, contact numbers for customer service in foreign languages, and banks providing foreign-language-supported ATMs and internet banking.

The guide instructs on how to navigate financial transactions in Korea, including understanding Korean banknotes, the country’s financial institutions, opening a bank account, using bank tellers, ATMs, internet, and mobile banking services. It also provides information on utility bills, including what they are and how to pay them. Anecdotal discussions about personal experiences in using financial services are also discussed.

The text is a discussion about financial experiences in Korea. The speaker recounts mistaking a 5,000 won bill for a 50,000 one, experiencing difficulties with calculating prices due to unfamiliarity with local currency abroad, and queries about internet and mobile banking. They express apprehensions about tasks like obtaining a digital certificate for online transactions and accidentally sending money to a wrong account. Nonetheless, there is encouragement to try out internet banking for its convenience. They also address a need to learn step by step about using financial services in Korea. Lastly, a useful tip is given: banking services including deposit, withdrawal, and money transfers can be conveniently conducted through one's bank, and online platforms can bring confidence to users once familiar with it.

The given text provides information about how to use banking services in Korea. It aims to educate readers, especially those new to Korea, on the country's currency, both in coin and banknote forms. It mentions that money (also referred to as banknotes) can appear unfamiliar to newcomers, which may lead them to pay higher amounts for goods due to misunderstanding the values of different denominations. Korean currency includes coins such as 1 won, 5 won, 10 won, 50 won, 100 won, and 500 won, as well as banknotes like 1,000 won, 5,000 won, 10,000 won, and 50,000 won. The text also gives examples of what you can buy with different denominations to offer a sense of the value these notes represent in everyday life. By understanding this, individuals can perform banking transactions without difficulty.

The text discusses the costs of various items and services in South Korea, with bus and subway fares ranging from 1,200 to 1,600 won, snacks and ice cream costing between 1,000 to 2,000 won, a meal at a restaurant costing between 6,000 to 10,000 won, and a 20 kg bag of rice costing around 50,000 to 60,000 won. It also discusses how to compare costs in the local currency to that of one's home country.

Additionally, it talks about the country's financial institutions, advising that it's safer to keep money in a bank rather than at home, because a bank can also provide interest earnings. Financial institutions in Korea are broadly categorized into banks and non-bank financial institutions. Banks offer a wide range of services including deposits, withdrawals, lending, remittances, currency exchange, card issuance, and bill payments, making them indispensable in Korean daily life. Non-bank financial institutions provide similar services.

In South Korea, there are several financial institutions such as mutual savings banks, community credit cooperatives, credit unions, agricultural cooperatives, fisheries cooperatives, and Korea Post that offer services similar to banks. They typically provide higher deposit and lending interest rates compared to banks. It's advisable for users to select the institution that best suits their needs, and make use of internet banking or mobile banking for transactions. When making a new account or in need of assistance, visiting a nearby institution would be more convenient. There are also insurance companies, securities companies, and credit card companies available. Additionally, institutions such as the Bank of Korea and the Financial Supervisory Service work to set up systems and supervise financial companies for smooth and safe financial transactions.

The Financial Supervisory Service provides useful information, resolves issues for financial consumers, and offers financial education. The text also advises selecting a primary bank for the majority of personal banking, stating that it could lead to benefits such as waived fees and preferentially reduced fees for certain services. This may include lowered fees for sending money abroad and favorable interest rates for savings deposits for foreign workers and multicultural families. Family members may also receive preferential treatment by collectively using the same bank. The text finally highlights that the first step to safely managing money through a bank is by opening an account, where documents beyond identification, such as those proving the purpose of the transaction, will be required.

The text is about different documents needed for an individual's identification, the importance of protecting personal identification numbers (PINs) for secure financial transactions, helpful tips for using banking services, and the process to open a bank account. 

For identification:
- Business operators need documents like a business registration certificate. 
- Workers require proof of current employment such as a certificate of employment. 
- Students need documents like a certificate of studentship. 
- Others may require additional documents for financial transactions. 

For PIN protection, it's advised not to base your PIN on easily guessed personal data like government-issued ID number, phone number, or date of birth to prevent exposure to hackers. It's also inadvisable to write down your PIN on your bankbook or share it with others. 

For banking services tips:
- It's important never to let others use your account, even if they offer to borrow or buy it. Such acts are illegal and could lead to criminal penalties. 
- If you lose items like your bankbook, cash card, or seal, you must report it to the bank immediately. 

To open a bank account, there are unspecified documents that the individual needs to bring.

To open a bank account, bring your identification (passport, alien registration card, or resident registration card), a name seal or signature, and a document proving the purpose of your financial transaction. Once at the bank, take a ticket from the dispenser and wait for your turn. Inform the teller you want to open an account and potentially apply for internet banking and a cash withdrawal card. Fill out an application form with your personal details and sign it. Creates a four-digit PIN for your account and cash withdrawal card. Ensure to keep your bankbook and cash withdrawal cards safe. When using a bank, take a number from the ticket dispenser, fill out the relevant application for the type of transaction you want to make.

This text explains the steps to correctly process a transaction at a bank. After filling out a transaction application form, signature or stamp approval is needed. When the queue number is called, the customer submits the application form at the teller counter along with their bankbook. After the transaction is completed, the customer checks if everything proceeded accurately. 

The customer has the benefit of asking any inquiries by communicating with the bank staff, but they must observe the bank's operating hours, usually from 9 am to 4 pm. For simpler tasks like transfers or deposits and withdrawals, an ATM can be used at any time, proving to be more convenient and cost-effective.

For those who wish to use ATM services independently, both a bankbook or a cash card can be utilized. ATMs offer several services such as cash deposits, withdrawals, checking account statements, and updating a bankbook. They support multiple languages hence can be used by non-Korean speakers too. However, one must ensure that others do not see the PIN while entering it.

The text provides instructions for using an ATM for withdrawals, deposits, and money transfers. To withdraw, insert your bankbook or cash card, press the withdrawal button, and enter your PIN. You can withdraw in 10,000 won or 50,000 won bills, or checks. The deposit process is similar, but coins, 1,000 won, and 5,000 won bills cannot be deposited using an ATM. Money can be transferred between accounts by selecting the 'money transfer' option and ensuring the recipient’s name and account number are correct. 

It suggests using your primary bank's ATM to avoid fees. There are withdrawal limits, typically between 700,000 and 1 million won at a time, and a daily limit of about 6 million won. For larger sums, it advises visiting a bank.

The document explains how to withdraw cash from an ATM and transfer money via an ATM. 

First for cash withdrawal, one should insert their cash card or bankbook into the ATM slot, press the 'Cash Withdrawal' button, enter their PIN and the amount they wish to take out. They should also choose their preferred bill size for large amounts. After checking the withdrawal amount and preferred banknotes on the screen, they confirm the transaction. An option to print a transaction receipt is available. Withdrawn money should be counted for accuracy.

For fund transfer, the process starts similarly by inserting the cash card or bankbook. The button to initiate transfer may vary by ATM and may be labelled as 'Send', 'Remittance', 'Transfer', or 'Transfer Work'.

The text provides instructions on how to securely use an ATM for money transfers and account management. The steps include entering the PIN securely, selecting a bank for money transfer, entering the recipient's account number, and confirming the transfer amount. It also suggests printing a receipt for more detailed transaction information. Additionally, it provides instructions on checking account balances and activities, such as deposits and withdrawals, and how to update the bankbook to print the most recent transaction records.

The text pertains to the use of ATM and Internet Banking (also known as electronic financial services). The ATM now supports multiple languages, making it more user-friendly. By pressing a button, the transaction record gets printed and the bankbook gets updated. Internet banking, accessible via a PC or laptop connected to the internet, allows for various transactions (like account checking and money transferring) without visiting the bank. This service has lower fees compared to traditional bank services and also provides interest benefits on certain products. To register for internet banking, users need to visit the bank with their personal identification.

The text provides information about signing up for internet banking. In order to use the service, users need to create an ID for internet banking before visiting the bank. After signing up, users need to download a Personal Digital Certificate, which serves as a digital ID, from the bank's website. Internet banking is available in several languages like English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Russian. The process of signing up includes visiting a bank branch, filling out a form, creating a user ID, setting up a maximum transfer amount, and creating a PIN for money transfers. The daily and one-time maximum transfer amounts limit how much money you can send from your account respectively per day and at one time. Users can also choose to use either a security code card or an OTP (One-Time Password) as a password for extra security against fraud and other criminal activities.

The text provides useful information on using financial services. It explains that users of an electronic bankbook, rather than a physical passbook, may receive preferential incentives such as reduced fees and higher interest rates from the bank. This is especially beneficial if the user primarily conducts their financial transactions through internet or mobile banking. The text also describes the use of a Security Code Card, which is the size of a regular business card and includes 30 to 35 four-digit security codes. These codes are required when using internet banking services. Additionally, it mentions the One Time Password (OTP), an electronic device used to generate a unique security code for each internet banking session.

The text discusses two important security features for banking: One-Time Passwords (OTP) and Digital Certificates. OTP is an automatic device that generates a unique six-digit number for each transaction, preventing unauthorized access or use. An OTP issued by one bank can be used for transactions at multiple banks. A security code card is given for free when signing up for internet banking. However, since the numbers are pre-printed, it's less secure than OTP. Never lend or give your card or OTP to anyone and report immediately if it's lost to receive a new one.

For bank transactions, just like you need an ID in person, you need a digital certificate for identity verification. Until 2020, the only type of certificate was the "Personal digital certificate," but now "digital certificate" or "financial certificate" can be used for internet banking. The digital certificate is simply a new name for the personal one, and individuals can select either type.

The text details how to receive a bank's push notification services and a digital certificate. When you sign up for your bank’s text message service or app push service, you can monitor money entering and exiting your account. This service can aid in reporting incidents like financial fraud to the bank or the police. You can sign up by visiting a financial institution, through a bank's website or app. App Push Service is free of charge, unlike text message service, which may include a fee. 

Furthermore, to obtain a digital certificate, you need a user ID, account number, PIN, and resident registration number or alien registration card number. Additionally, you need the PIN for money transfer authorization, a security code card or OTP, and a portable storage device. You can apply for this by logging into your bank's website and following the procedure in the digital certificate menu.

The text guides on how to incorporate a digital certificate. It instructs to visit the certification center and select the 'issue' option. Then, choose the digital certificate purpose based on needs like bank, credit card, or insurance. The issuance is free of charge. It's important to read and consent to the terms and conditions. User identity should be verified by providing pertinent information such as resident card number, account number, PIN, and security code. Depending on the bank’s policy, users might undergo an identity verification procedure. Lastly, you should enter a password for your digital certificate and decide where to store it, recommending a portable storage device over a computer for safety purposes.

The text primarily provides instructions on creating secured passwords by using a combination of alphabets, numbers, and special characters. It advises against using sensitive personal information like alien registration numbers, birth dates, and phone numbers as passwords. The text also explains the process of storing and obtaining a financial certificate–an authorization developed by the Korea Financial Telecommunications, Clearings Institute, and banks, which can be used for banking services. The certificate is stored in the KFTC's cloud storage, eliminating the need for a physical storage device or additional security programs. It remains valid for three years and uses a simpler six-digit PIN system. The process of obtaining a financial certificate mirrors that of obtaining a digital certificate; this can be achieved by visiting the issuing bank's website.

Internet banking allows for checking of account activities anytime, anywhere by logging in with a digital or financial certificate. Desired intervals can be set for account checks. It is advised to keep digital certificates in a portable storage device like a USB for safety, and to avoid keeping the device plugged into the computer for long periods. When using public computers caution is recommended due to the risk of hacking. Sending money through internet banking is free within the same bank but may incur small fees when sending to different banks, though certain conditions may waive these fees, and users will be notified of any fees before confirming the transaction. Entering incorrect passwords repeatedly will lead to a termination of banking services, requiring a visit to the bank to reactivate.

The text provides instructions on sending money to another person using internet banking. It emphasizes the importance of carefully double-checking the recipient's bank, account number, and name before money is sent to avoid errors. It also lays out a step-by-step guide on transferring money: 

1. First, access your bank's website.
2. Log in to your account by selecting your digital certificate and entering the appropriate password.
3. Finally, click on [Money Transfer], and enter the transfer/deposit account information, which includes the recipient's bank, account number, and the amount of money to be sent.

In case of mistakenly entering a password and locking the account, the text advises changing the passwords in person to regain access to the banking service.

The text describes the steps of using a bank transfer. It includes first entering details about the sender and receiver (like the receiving bank, account number, and transfer amount). After this, users should verify the entered information and input their password for money transfer authorization and the security card number or OTP code. Clicking on "Proceed" will initiate the transfer. If using a digital or financial certificate for transferring, the users should also enter the corresponding password. Lastly, the text advises using a mouse to input passwords on the virtual keyboard in order to prevent risk from keyboard hacking.

The text describes various banking services. The "transfer-delay service" allows users to send money to another person's account after a delay of at least three hours, during which the transaction can be canceled. This is useful in avoiding mistakes. The service can be applied for via internet banking or by visiting a bank branch. If money has already been sent to the wrong account, the bank can be immediately contacted for a refund. However, getting the money back can be difficult if the recipient can't be reached or if there are legal complications. In such cases, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation's 'Scheme to Support Return of Misdirected Money Transfer' can be applied for. 

Mobile banking services are also discussed. Here, users can undertake banking tasks using smart devices, much like how they'd use internet banking. These tasks include checking account balances, transferring money, and paying bills.

The text discusses various bank services available with the use of a smartphone, including account checking, money transfers, payment of utility bills, and deposits and savings. To access these services through mobile banking, one must sign up for Internet banking, install a banking app, and download a digital certificate onto the smartphone. Instructions for such processes can be found on a bank's website's Digital Certificate Center. If already using a financial certificate for internet banking, this can be utilized from the Cloud without additional procedures. A tip is given for changing smartphones: to back up the digital certificate in advance to prevent difficulties in the use of mobile banking services due to deletion of the certificate. Additionally, instructions for copying a digital certificate from a PC to Smartphone are provided but not entirely detailed in the given text.

The text outlines steps to copy a digital certificate from a PC to a smartphone using mobile banking apps and a bank's website. 

1. First, launch the mobile banking app on your smartphone.
2. Access your bank's website on your PC and log in.
3. Select 'Copy Certificate for Smartphone,' and 'Copy Certificate from PC to Smartphone (Send)' from the Digital Certificate Center. Note that the menu names might vary depending on the bank.
4. Choose the certificate you want to copy and enter its PIN number.
5. Enter the generated PIN (approval number) or take a photo of the QR code displayed on the PC screen.
6. Confirm the process. 

Following these steps, the certificate on the PC is copied to the smartphone.

The text instructs on how to pay utility bills, which are statements for payment of services that an individual uses at home, like electricity, water, and gas. These bills generally arrive through mail, indicating the amount used in the previous month. It is necessary to check the payment due date as forgetting to pay by this deadline can accrue late fees. If payments are missed consistently, there could be a disruption in service.

Ensure to pay your utility bills to avoid service interruptions. Bills sent to incorrect addresses can cause late or missed payments, so maintain a current mailing address. Opt for receiving bills by email or text for timely payments. Payment methods include internet or mobile banking, where you navigate to the 'utility bill' section and select your bill type. Alternatively, the Giro website allows convenient payment of various bills and taxes. Automatic withdrawal is another method, setting up an automatic monthly payment from your bank account.

The text outlines the convenience of automatic withdrawal systems, which avoid the need for repeatedly visiting the bank for payments. However, it advises making sure that there's enough money in the bank account to avoid late fees. Automatic withdrawal can be set up by visiting the bank, through internet banking, or mobile banking. 

The text also guides on paying utility bills using Giro Homepage (www.giro.or.kr). The steps include visiting the bank or Giro homepage, logging in with a digital certificate, entering the customer or Giro number from the utility bill statement, and inputting the payment account number.

The text explains different payment methods and financial services. Users are required to enter their bank account information, their resident registration or alien registration card number, and their account PIN to confirm their payment. An automatic withdrawal or transfer reservation service is convenient for those who need to transfer money not only for utility bills, but also for monthly rent, pocket money, and membership fees. A special bill-paying machine at the bank can also be used to make payments, though if this is at a bank other than one's primary, a fee may be charged. For using a bill-paying machine, customers should visit their bank with the utility bill and bankbook (or card).

The text instructs customers on how to use banking services to pay utility bills through various methods. First, one can tear the Giro bill from the customer receipt and insert the bill into the machine. The payment can be made via bankbook or card using a four-digit PIN. The receipt should be kept as proof of payment.

Alternatively, payment can be made at a bank teller or post office by presenting the Giro bill. Lastly, a story is shared about a woman who set up automatic bank payments for her bills, but received a late charge because she did not have enough funds in her account. This resulted in two months' worth of bills being deducted at once when she eventually had sufficient funds.

The text provides financial tips such as keeping your utility bill receipt as proof of payment, contacts and alternatives for if you lose the bill. It also discusses advantages of using banks for safekeeping and growing one's money via interest. The use of ATMs, internet banking, and mobile banking is recommended for accessibility and flexibility. People who can't speak Korean can still use banking services, as some branches have interpretation services plus there are call centers with foreign language speakers. Multiple options for paying utility bills (Giro) are discussed, including internet banking, mobile banking, Giro homepage, automatic withdrawal service, and direct bank or post office visits. Utility bills can also be received by mail, e-mail or text message.

When you receive a utility bill payment notice, you can pay it in various ways, such as internet banking, mobile banking, internet giro, automatic transfer services, or by visiting a bank or post office. You can receive the payment notice not only by mail but also by email and text messages.

There are also various ways to save money such as fixed savings deposits and fixed installment savings, savings with tax benefits, savings accounts for apartment purchases, and depositor protection systems. 

The story also discusses the option of renewing a jeonse (rental) contract in Korea. Usually, jeonse contracts last for two years, but they have the option to be renewed for two additional years. However, upon renewal, the landlord can raise the deposit up to 5%. The story ends with the speaker expressing relief for having fixed installment savings to cover the increased deposit amount.

The text is discussing the importance of effectively saving money for unexpected events or situations which may require considerable sums, such as family illness, college tuition, home purchase, or rental deposit increases. It recommends the use of fixed installment savings or fixed deposit savings as a way to build a substantial sum due to their higher interest rates, rather than a traditional savings account with a low interest. For large purchases, opening specific accounts such as a housing subscription savings account is recommended, as this provides the opportunity to buy a newly built apartment, with even foreign residents able to open this account. The importance of having a savings plan and setting aside a portion of earnings as savings before spending is emphasized, particularly for marriage immigrants who may find banks with savings products that offer high interest rates.

The text tells the story of a woman who came to Korea 15 years ago from the Philippines. She was living on a farm with her husband and two children. Unfortunately, her husband was hospitalized due to a brain hemorrhage and she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Despite the financial help she receives from the community, she deeply regrets not having health insurance or a savings account. The text suggests that one should save 20 to 30 percent of their income to prepare for unexpected circumstances. Some common financial products include fixed savings deposits, installment savings, and free savings accounts that can help manage and save money effectively to cope with unforeseen events.

The text explains that you can deposit money freely before a maturity day, without limits on amount or frequency. The interest rates for this are generally higher than for fixed savings. These rates can change, so checking regularly is advised to secure the most beneficial plan. Internet-only banks usually offer higher interest rates than traditional banks. Also, rates for online-only products within the same bank are generally higher. Additionally, rates for savings banks are typically higher than those for commercial banks. For fixed savings and installment savings, which have a set maturity period, withdrawing money early may result in lost interest, so maintaining the account until maturity is recommended. The following summarizes different types of savings: time deposits involve depositing a large sum for a certain period, while installment savings involve depositing a small sum monthly. It closes by offering tips for choosing the best financial services and ways to increase interest rates.

The information network “FINE” lists various financial products. Some banks may offer additional interest as a special promotion, even if they are not listed on FINE. At the time of opening an account, banks may provide additional interest depending on the transaction activities of the account holder. Using one bank primarily is considered advantageous, and if one is over 65 years of age, they can open a ‘Tax-Free Savings Account.’ In case of a sudden need for a large sum, considering a savings deposit and installment savings mortgage loan is suggested rather than withdrawing money pre-maturity. The interest rate for these is usually lower than regular loans and there are no additional fees for early payment before the maturity date. It's also beneficial for users to consider savings products that offer tax benefits. The most common tax-free or tax-favored savings accounts are offered by mutual financial companies like the Credit Union, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, and the National Federation of Forestries and Fisheries Cooperatives.

Financial companies offer tax-free or tax-favored savings accounts for employees or entrepreneurs. The Individual Savings Account (ISA) can be opened at banks or securities firms, offering tax breaks on income ranging from 2 million to 4 million won. Besides deposits, the ISA permits investments in various financial products. However, tax benefits apply for investments held over three years, and periodic fees may be incurred. There's also a Savings Account for Apartment Purchases, for those wishing to apply for a newly built apartment. Foreign residents can open this account using their alien registration card but are ineligible for year-end tax returns. Additionally, multicultural families may receive preferential apartment allocation, exempt from bidding, if they meet certain conditions.

The text outlines a potential financial opportunity for both individuals and foreign residents living in non-overheated areas of South Korea. This involves opening a savings account with flexibility to deposit between 20,000 and 500,000 won per month until the right to purchase is acquired. The interest rate ranges from 0% for less than 1 month up to 1.8% for longer than 2 years as of October 2021. Priority is given to non-homeowners who've held the account for over a year and made at least 12 deposits. Also mentioned is the Depositor Protection System; the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees the principal and interest earned up to 50 million won, and advises the dispersion of amounts larger than this across multiple banks. While products like funds are excluded from this protection, an account holder can check a product's eligibility via the KDIC website.

The text provides tips on how to save money:

1. Rate of return can be increased on savings deposits and installment savings by comparing interest rates on different products at the Financial Supervisory Service website. If you need money urgently, consider only terminating a part of the savings product and/or taking a deposit and savings mortgage loan.
 
2. Tax-favored products should be used, including savings products offered by a mutual financial association. Clients can sign up for an Individual Savings Account and receive tax breaks on income up to 4 million won. Those over 65 can join a tax-free savings plan.

3. A housing subscription savings account can be used to purchase a newly built apartment. Households with a foreign spouse who has lived at the same address for more than three years and without a pre-owned house can acquire an apartment without bidding.

4. Deposits are protected up to 50 million won under the Depositor Protection Act. Therefore, if the funds are substantial, it's advisable to disperse the money into different banks.

The text provides information on how to use payment cards including common payment cards, advantages of using check cards and credit cards, and the precautions one should take while using them. It also highlights the convenience of using public transportation cards and the benefits available for pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare. One example given is a conversation between two individuals discussing the benefits of using a check card over a credit card due to immediate withdrawal which discourages overspending. The text advises a planned spending habit, especially when using a credit card to avoid overspending.

The text provides information on how to use payment cards in Korea. The use of payment cards, typically check cards or credit cards, is preferred due to their convenience and the potential of earning additional benefits such as cash back and credit points. Using payment cards also reduces the risk of losing cash. Compared to check cards which have a limit based on the balance in a connected account and are settled immediately upon purchase, credit cards have a personal credit limit and the payment is settled on a specific date every month. Credit cards also have additional features such as installment payments, short-term card loans or cash advance services. Both types of cards can be used as traffic cards.

This text describes the use of check cards and necessary precautions. A check card instantly withdraws money from the bank account, therefore, one must ensure a sufficient balance before using it. Applying for a Short Message Service (SMS) during card issuance is important as it sends usage history via text and helps prevent illegal use due to loss or theft. A case is shared about a foreign worker who was able to prevent further damage after losing her card, as she received alerts of its use. The text emphasizes that one should sign the signature line on the check card and report a lost card immediately to the card company. It also warns against lending or transferring the card to someone else, as the damage caused from such actions is not compensable by the card company.

The given text discusses the usage of credit cards in Korea and precautions to be taken by cardholders. A credit card is a payment method used for buying goods or services that the cardholder can pay for later. Before the issuance of a credit card, the issuer needs to check and verify the cardholder's ability to pay back the money. The process includes evaluating credit risk using personal information like residence status, place of work, property ownership, and credit history. Credit card companies may reject applicants without an employment status in Korea, therefore it's advised to check with the bank or card company before applying. Some companies also offer a "family card" based on the spouse's credit score which provides advantages such as discounts and installment payment without interest at retail stores, gas stations, etc. The text ends with a case of a person, 'A', who couldn't avail bank loan due to low credit score caused by missed credit card payment, exemplifying the importance of maintaining a good credit history.

The text explains that failing to meet credit card payments can negatively affect one's credit score and ability to secure a bank loan. In terms of usage, credit cards offer the possibility to purchase goods on an installment basis, which can be helpful when someone is short on funds or faced with a large purchase. However, installment fees can sometimes be higher than savings deposit fees. It's also necessary to report a lost credit card immediately and to sign the back of the card to ensure compensation for potential damages. Furthermore, credit card holders can borrow cash from their credit card company through ATMs or phone calls, but this should be done cautiously due to high interest rates and potential harm to the credit rating. It is important to make credit card payments on time to avoid late fees.

The text stresses the importance of managing credit card spending. If a credit card debt is not paid on time, the credit card company may demand a higher interest rate, and it could negatively affect your credit at other financial institutions. Therefore, using a check card or limiting the amount of credit cards to one or two could better help you spend within your budget. Also, having a credit card limit higher than the appropriate cost of living can cause financial difficulties because of overspending, so adjusting the card limit according to your income and circumstances is advised. The text provides four tips: firstly, keep your payment card PIN secure; secondly, check your account balance in advance before using a check card; thirdly, pay your credit card bills on time; finally, report lost cards immediately to prevent unauthorized transactions.

When you lose your card, immediately report it to your card company or bank to suspend its usage and apply for a new card. If it hasn't been your major fault, the card company can compensate for unauthorized usage up to 60 days prior to the report. Upon receiving a new card, sign on the back immediately. Failing to do so makes getting compensation for lost or misplaced cards difficult. Do not lend your card to others; damage occurring from that will not be compensated by the card company. Keep your card to yourself. 

In South Korea, public transportation cards are popular for their convenience, eliminating the need to carry cash for fares for buses, subways, or taxis. These prepaid cards, such as T-money and Cashbee, can be charged with needed amounts and used all over the country. They can be purchased and recharged at subway stations, convenience stores, and street vendors.

This text provides information on the use of credit and check cards in South Korea. In essence, they can be used to pay for fares and later bills at financial companies. When issued by a financial company, they can include public transportation card options, enabling the card to function as both a credit card and a public transportation card. These cards can be purchased at different locations such as convenience stores or street kiosks. Additionally, teenagers and children can receive discounts if they register their date of birth at a convenience store or convert their cards to children's cards and register their birthdays on the website within 10 days. Furthermore, the National Happiness Card – a card issued to provide government vouchers – is introduced. It provides a voucher to purchase services or goods instead of giving direct cash or services to welfare recipients. Foreign residents are also eligible for this voucher if they are registered as enrollees or dependents in the National Health Insurance.

The national health insurance plan member or dependent must first obtain a National Happiness Card to avail the government voucher. This card can be issued at various outlets including banks, post offices, Nonghyup (NH), and credit card companies. They can also apply through a website or call center. However, after obtaining this card, users are required to apply separately for the voucher service. The procedure and required documents may vary depending on the service provider. For further information, individuals can visit the National Happiness Card website or their jurisdiction's Community Service Center. They can then access the “Find a voucher that suits you” feature on the website and apply for the desired voucher service.

The text provides information on various types of financial assistance and how to apply for them:

1. National Health Insurance: Offers one million won for each pregnancy, and 1.4 million won for a woman carrying two or more fetuses. Applications can be done online or by visiting a branch of the National Health Insurance Corporation.

This text details several financial assistance programs in Korea as of January 2022. Full-day and part-time in-home child care support offers hourly support ranging from 1,506 to 8,534 won based on income class, to be applied for at the community service center. The female youth sanitary napkin voucher provides up to 144,000 won per year for purchasing sanitary napkins. First meeting pass support is provided via the National Happiness Card, with voucher points worth 2 million won to alleviate the financial burden of raising children in the early stages. Lastly, a local currency card means a method of payment issued by local governments for circulation and use only in member stores within its jurisdiction. Applications for these services can be made at the administrative welfare center, community center, or on their respective websites.

Local currency can be issued in three forms: paper, card, and mobile. This can be used within the balance of a local currency card. Issue requests can be made by installing a local currency app provided by local governments such as provincial offices, city halls, or county offices. Alternatively, you can apply through a bank which has signed a contract with a local government. Usage of local currency cards is incentivised by providing cash to users, between a minimum of 5% to a maximum of about 30% of the spent amount. Each local government sets monthly usage limits per person and if the budget runs out, there won't be any support. For more information on local currency, visit the Local Administration Integrated Information System website.

The text informs that foreign residents registered under the national health insurance plan may be eligible for financial aid for hospital expenses related to prenatal, delivery and post-natal care. The benefits and application methods vary and can be checked at the Community Service Center or on the National Happiness Card website. The National Happiness Card is necessary to use government vouchers and can be obtained from banks, post offices, or credit card companies. Using a local card provides a discount or cashback service from 5% to 30% of the amount spent. This can be applied for at a bank contracted with a local government or via a local currency app. Using the local card up to the monthly limit first before using other cards can help lower household expenditure.

The text categorizes different types of insurance into Social Insurance, Foreign Worker-Only Insurance, and Private Insurance. Social Insurance comprises National Health Insurance Service, Unemployment Insurance, Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance, and National Pension Plan. For Foreign Workers, there are specific insurances such as the Return-Home Expense Insurance, Accident Insurance, Departure Guarantee Insurance and Guarantee Insurance. Private Insurance includes Whole Life Insurance, Term Life Insurance, Sickness Insurance, Automobile Insurance, Pension Insurance, and Variable Insurance. It also cautions consumers to be alert when taking up insurance. A conversation follows about a recent car accident, discussing the importance of automobile insurance, specifically automobile liability insurance, for covering heavy repair costs.

The text talks about two types of car insurances: liability insurance and composite automobile insurance. The former only covers damage inflicted to another person or their vehicle in case of an accident, while the latter provides coverage in case the insured is injured or his/her car is damaged. The individual in the text initially chose the cheaper option - liability insurance, but plans to switch to composite insurance in the next year as they believe it cost more this time. The text further advises the importance of various kinds of insurances in Korea, some mandatory others private, to mitigate risks and difficulties that can arise like sickness or accidents. Comparing these insurance plans in respect to their premium and coverage is recommended before purchasing. Lastly, insurance services are explained which pool money from a number of people to prepare for unexpected difficulties such as death, illness, disability, unemployment or old age. The insurance money is then provided in the event of an accident.

The text discusses the importance of insurance and its types, which include social and private insurance. Insurance provides financial benefits in the event of accidents or illnesses. Many types have long-term contracts and premiums are payable over this period. For example, automobile insurance usually has a contract term of one year, whereas life insurance has a much longer term. It is crucial to understand the terms and conditions before buying any insurance because if the policy is cancelled before the term ends, premiums paid may not be refunded. 

Social insurance is offered by the government to cover social risks for the citizens. In Korea, these include the National Health Insurance, Employment Insurance, National Pension, and Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance. There is also specific insurance for foreign workers. 

Private insurance is purchased from private companies to prepare for personal risks that may arise in the future. The text mentions companies such as OO Life Insurance, XX Fire, and △△ Non-life insurance as examples.

The text discusses four major insurance programs provided by the Korean government. These are: 

1. The National Health Insurance Service, which covers medical treatment and preventative health care.
2. Unemployment Insurance, which temporarily supports those out of work while they seek employment.
3. Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance, which provides compensation to those who have been injured or have died while working.
4. The National Pension Plan, which supports retirees who can no longer work.

Specifically, the National Health Insurance Corporation collects premiums from citizens which are then used to cover the expenses of those receiving medical treatment.

The text provides information on enrolling in the National Health Insurance program in Korea for foreign residents. It explains that whether you or your spouse are working will determine how you can join. 

1) If you're employed, you can enroll by submitting necessary documents to your employer. 
2) If your spouse is employed and you are dependent on them, you can receive health benefits through their insurance. To do this, you must visit a National Health Insurance Corporation office and submit the required forms and documents.
3) If both you and your spouse are self-employed or day laborers and can't enroll through an employer, you can apply for the regional health insurance service having resided in Korea for over 180 days. However, not paying the premium has implications, including having to cover full medical costs during non-payment periods and potentially limiting visa extensions.

Foreign language services, including English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Uzbek, are available over the phone at ☎033-811-2000.

During the delinquency period, individuals will have to pay the full cost of using a medical institution and visa extension may be restricted. If one is not enrolled in the National Health Insurance because they have equivalent medical coverage under the laws of their home country or own insurance, they can apply for exclusion from the National Health Insurance benefits at the nearest National Health Insurance Corporation branch. The National Health Service Insurance's website offers services in various languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese, and it allows reservations for consultations. Foreigner Civil Service Centers are available in Seoul, Ansan, Suwon, Incheon, Uijeongbu for foreigners and overseas Koreans living there. Foreigners and overseas Koreans from other regions can receive civil services affiliated with the National Health Insurance. Unemployment Insurance is provided by the Ministry of Employment.

Unemployment insurance offers temporary income support to those who have been laid off due to workplace difficulties. It also helps unemployed individuals develop new vocational skills. Foreign workers' enrollment in the program might vary depending on their visa status; those with a resident, permanent resident, or marriage immigrant visa must enroll, while others may choose to do so or not be eligible for insurance. If you have been part of the insurance program for 6 months or longer and have lost your job or are looking for a new one, you are entitled to this support. More details can be obtained from the Ministry of Employment and Labor's contact center. Additionally, the text mentions the use of Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance, available via the Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service.

The Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance program provides timely and fair treatment and compensation to workers and their families who are injured or die at work. It also focuses on preventing accidents and injuries at the workplace. Employers usually apply for the workers, while self-application is possible through a helpline. If a foreign worker is injured, the employer cannot fire or repatriate them.

The National Pension System provides pensions for those experiencing loss of income due to illness, old age, and disability. Anyone under 59 living in Korea, including foreigners, must enroll. Foreigners between 18 and under 60 can enroll as employer-sponsored or regional enrollees. Exceptions exist for compulsory enrollment, especially for exchange students, trainees, and diplomats. Certain foreign nationals from countries that do not insist on compulsory enrollment for Koreans are also exempt.

Residents of certain countries may be exempt from compulsory participation in the National Pension Plan based on agreements with their home country. For eligibility and more information, they can visit or contact the National Pension Service. The age of eligibility for National Pension Benefits varies from 61 to 65 depending on the year of birth. 22 countries, including Georgia, Nigeria, and South Africa, are exempt from compulsory participation. The National Pension System Handbook is available in 15 languages on the National Pension website, which contains a downloadable PDF of the 'National Pension Handbook for Foreigner'.

The text refers to two types of compulsory insurance for foreign workers in Korea: Return-Home Expense Insurance and Accident Insurance. Employers or foreign workers who do not subscribe may face fines or penalties. 

Return-Home Expense Insurance, handled by Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, is for foreign workers with non-professional employment (E-9) and work and visit (H-2) visas. This insurance helps cover expenses when foreign workers return to their home country. The insurance premium is between 400,000 to 600,000 won, depending on their nationality, and can be split into three payments. Customers need to sign up directly within three months of starting work in Korea.

Accident Insurance helps protect foreign workers from financial losses due to death, accidents, or illness incurred outside of work accidents. Subscription must take place within 15 days from the start date of the work contract. Insurance premiums vary based on age, gender, and the duration of the work contract, and more information should be obtained directly from the insurance company.

The text talks about two types of insurances by Samsung and Seoul Guarantee Insurance that must be purchased by employers who hire foreign workers for more than a year. The first is the "Departure Guarantee Insurance", signed up for by the employer who may have to pay retirement costs. The premium is 8.3% of the worker’s regular monthly wage and in case of the worker's departure, specific intentional procedures should be followed. 

The second is the "Guarantee Insurance", which safeguards foreign workers against unpaid wages due to employer's bankruptcy or business closing. Workers covered by this insurance can receive up to 4 million won if due wage is not paid. The sign-up for the insurance needs to be done within 15 days from the starting date of the labour contract. 

Additionally, since November 2018, related services of corporation are also available on their mobile app.

Private insurance offered by companies covers various risks, but the types and coverage can often be complex. Two main types of policies include whole life and term life insurance. Both are designed to provide financial assistance to bereaved families after the death of an insured family member. Whole life insurance provides financial protection regardless of when the insured person dies; term life insurance provides protection only during a pre-set period, which may result in no payout if the person does not die within that time. However, term life insurance's premiums are generally lower. Both types of policies offer add-ons for coverage of hospitalization, surgery, injury treatment, and medical expenses.

The text highlights two types of insurance policies that cover medical expenses for treating illnesses and injuries: Indemnity Health Insurance and Fixed Benefit Insurance. Indemnity Health Insurance covers the actual medical expenses incurred by the policyholder. However, it doesn't allow for duplicate coverage, meaning if a policyholder purchases multiple policies of this type, they cannot claim benefits exceeding their total medical expenses. Insurers divide payment proportionately to avoid overlapping coverage.

Fixed Benefit Insurance, conversely, provides coverage for specified illnesses like cancer, stroke, etc., according to the policy terms and offers duplicate coverage. But purchasing multiple policies of this kind can increase the premium payment, creating potential financial burden.

Indemnity health insurance compensates the amount less the deductible from the total medical expense and uncovered expenses among those covered by National Health Insurance. However, expenses related to cosmetic surgery, check-ups, vaccinations, and nursing are not covered.

The text provides information about indemnity health insurance. If you are a recipient of medical benefits, you can get a discount on your indemnity health insurance premiums by submitting proof of documents. The price of medicine prescribed by a doctor is often covered by the indemnity health insurance. You should keep all pharmacy and hospital bills and check your insurance contract carefully. 

A comparison between Indemnity Health Insurance and Fixed Benefit Health Insurance is also offered. Indemnity insurance covers most illnesses and injuries with benefits covering 70-80% of medical expenses and allows duplicate coverage. On the contrary, fixed benefit insurance specifies certain illnesses or injuries, offers a fixed amount as stated in the terms, and provides benefits regardless of multiple plans. 

Indemnity insurance has wide coverage but premiums are recalculated each time the contract is renewed, while fixed benefit insurance provides high coverage for specified illnesses, but doesn't cover illnesses other than those specified. 

For insurance money claims under one million won, these can be easily applied for using the insurance company's mobile app.

The text revolves around different insurance schemes and their usages. Firstly, it discusses a 'temporary payment system' for those unable to afford high medical bills. In this system, the insurance company pays a portion of the medical expense in advance. This method is especially beneficial for type 1 & 2 recipients under the Medical Care Assistance Act, people with severe illnesses or those with interim medical expenses of 3 million won or more. These individuals can receive 70% of the expected insurance money, with the rest paid at final settlement. The text also mentions automobile insurance, which is comprised of mandatory liability insurance and optional comprehensive insurance. These insurances provide coverage for personal and material damage caused by automobile accidents.

The text addresses insurance, focusing on liability, composite, and pension insurance. If you only have liability insurance, you will bear the costs of damages exceeding the compensation limit. Comprehensive insurance covers damages for both you and the victim, including if the person who caused the accident is uninsured. With continuing increases in life expectancy, pension insurance is crucial for post-retirement financial security. It complements national pension schemes and is chosen voluntarily by individuals. The enrollment period can be long because its aim is to support retirees. One should carefully consider their income before choosing a plan to avoid premature termination and loss of paid premiums. Lastly, the text hints at ways to reduce car insurance premiums, emphasizing safe driving since premiums can vary based on accident history.

The text discusses methods to reduce car insurance premiums, including safe driving and using special clauses for discounts particularly for those who use cars sparingly or have a black box installed in their vehicles. It also highlights the importance of clearly specifying who will drive the insured car, cautioning that anyone else driving the vehicle will not be covered by insurance in case of an accident. It warns against violations of major traffic laws which can lead to increased premiums. The text also mentions the advantage of the 'Enrollment (Driver Experience) Recognition System' where past driving records can help reduce insurance premiums. The document outlines a preferential car insurance system for low-income individuals, including married couples with a joint annual income of less than 40 million Won owning a 5-year-old or older car. Lastly, the text describes variable insurance where a part of the premium paid is invested in a fund, offering the potential for significant profits and varying insurance payouts, based on the fund's performance.

The passage discusses a type of insurance product that combines a fund and insurance coverage, wherein policyholders can earn high returns based on asset management performance, but can also suffer huge losses. Thus, careful consideration is required before signing up. Various insurance products are available, including variable annuity insurance for financial help, and variable whole life insurance for death. Each type provides unique benefits, such as premium income deduction and tax benefits for insurance profit. Consumers are also cautioned to familiarize themselves with the terms and conditions of any existing insurance policies to avoid duplication coverage or omission of necessary coverage. It's also stressed that it is important to compare various insurance products to find the one that suits individual needs best, using resources like the E-insmarket of the Financial Supervisory Service FINE for more information.

The 보험협회, 생명보험협회, and the Korea Life Insurance Association operate an online insurance supermarket where people can select their preferred types of insurance and compare various insurance products from different companies. They also offer the Financial Supervisory Service FINE and E-insmarket for more details and services. Customers are advised to consider their ability to pay insurance premiums as they will need to maintain contracts for long periods to receive a large insurance pay-out. This can be a burden if your income is not steady, and terminating the contract prematurely can result in losses. It is also important to inform insurance companies of any significant information when signing a contract, like past illnesses, current disabilities, occupation, driving and smoking habits, etc.

Individuals must disclose their full medical history, current occupation, and lifestyle choices to the insurance company before signing a contract. If they do not, the company may refuse to pay out in the case of an incident. It's essential to thoroughly understand the insurance contract before signing it. Keeping a copy of all documents related to the policy can be helpful for future reference. Customers have the right to cancel insurance contracts within specific timeframes if they did not receive all necessary information or documentation. It's also recommended to sign up for mandatory health insurance and pay premiums regularly to receive government support in case of serious illnesses, especially for foreign residents living in Korea for six months or longer.

The text provides advice on health insurance and money transactions. 

1. It mentions that residents in Korea who stay for six months or longer must enroll in the National Health Insurance, which helps cover a portion of medical expenses, regardless of their employment status.
  
2. It also suggests considering one's income when selecting an insurance plan, highlighting the importance of Insurance that can be continuously maintained to cater for sudden situations like illness or death.
   
3. It advises against signing up for an insurance plan solely based on others' recommendations, pointing out potential issues like overlapping coverage and problems with early termination.

The text also provides a guide on "How to Exchange and Send Money Abroad," describing various methods, including doing so through bank tellers, internet and mobile banking, wire transfer services, ATMs, and personalized money transfer services.

The text is a conversation about overseas money transfers in Korea. Susan is feeling worried because she needs to quickly send money to her family after her brother got into a car accident, however, she is unsure how to do it and is concerned about high bank fees. Someone suggested sending money through a known broker, but was advised against it as it is illegal in Korea. Instead, they recommend using their company's primary bank, OO Bank, which offers discounts on the exchange rate and transfer fees for foreign workers with payroll bank accounts. It is also suggested that they could send money online, given the high internet penetration rate in Korea.

The text provides a tip on sending money abroad. There are multiple methods to send money overseas, which have various fees and transfer times. The text also expounds on the concept of exchange rates, which denote the conversion rate between different currencies. For instance, if 1,000 Korean won equals 1 US dollar (USD), and 1,000 won equals 100 Japanese yen (JPY). Exchange rates fluctuate due to individual economic conditions or global economic trends. Additionally, if the exchange rate increases, you'll pay more in your home currency when sending money abroad. As such, maintaining a foreign currency account at a local bank can help minimize losses due to exchange rate fluctuations.

The text suggests to mitigate potential losses from fluctuating exchange rates by setting up a foreign currency bank account and depositing a certain amount monthly. It highlights different currencies worldwide including U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Filipino peso, European Euro, Vietnamese dong, U.K pound, Cambodian riel, Thai Baht, Russian ruble, and Indonesian rupiah. It mentions that different types of exchange rates can be checked at banks or online, including rates for buying and selling foreign currency, rates for sending and receiving remittances, and rates for buying traveler’s checks, which can be used like cash abroad.

When visiting a bank, one can easily see an electronic monitor displaying variable exchange rates for different currencies throughout the day. For more convenience, these rates can also be checked online through the bank's website or by searching "exchange rate" on the internet. Changing money, or converting it to a different country's currency, commonly occurs at a bank. For foreigners, currency exchange is permitted within the limit stated in their proof of purchase documents. If there is no such document, one can exchange up to 10,000 US dollars, but the exchange must be indicated in their passport.

Ensure to bring your passport when exchanging money. Required documents for foreigners or non-residents include an ID card (passport, alien registration card, or resident registration card). If you are exchanging more than USD 10,000, you will also need a Certificate of purchased foreign currency or a declaration of means of foreign payment. After taking a ticket and waiting for your turn, inform the bank teller that you intend to exchange money and fill out an application form, providing your name, ID number, and the amount to be exchanged. Then, pay for the currency you are purchasing and check the amount. If no additional documents are necessary, the exchange details will be described in your passport.

The text discusses options for exchanging money using both physical and digital banking services. Banks may offer special exchange rates, discounted fees or coupons to loyal customers, so it's advisable to check for these before going to a bank. Alternatively, foreign currency exchange can be done online through non-face-to-face services like internet banking or mobile banking, which often provide more favorable exchange rates. After applying online, you need to visit the specified bank branch within a certain period to collect the exchanged money. Failure to do so may result in automatic re-exchange into Korean currency and being refunded to your account, possibly leading to losses due to exchange fees and fluctuating exchange rates. The text also provides steps on how to use these digital services for money exchange.

To exchange and send money abroad through your bank's website or mobile banking, follow these steps:
1. Click on the currency exchange menu.
2. Enter the required information including the purpose of your exchange (like travel or future use), the pick up date for the exchanged money, the currency to be purchased, the exchange amount, the account number for withdrawal and your account password.
3. Choose a convenient bank branch for pick up.
4. Click on [Request] and enter your digital certificate password to complete the exchange.
5. Print a receipt pre-visit to the bank for convenience.
6. Visit the selected bank branch with an ID (such as a passport or registration card) to pick up the purchased currency.

The text provides tips for utilizing financial services, specifically related to currency exchange and sending money abroad. You can check preferential rates of internet exchange fees for each bank and exchangeable currencies to choose the bank with the lowest fees, via the Korea Federation of Banks Foreign Exchange Guide. One can save exchange fees by using the double exchange system - converting Korean won to US Dollars, and then converting Dollars to the local currency in the destination country. Additionally, it includes details about overseas remittance, which is used for sending money from Korea to another country, primarily to family and relatives.

To make overseas transfers, a specific foreign exchange bank must be designated, and transfers must be made only through that bank. Transfers up to USD50,000 per year can be made without documentation, but amounts exceeding this require documents such as pay stubs and a record of previous money exchanges involving Korean won. However, even transfers below USD50,000 can be subject to additional documentation if illegal activities are suspected. The remittance process usually involves domestic and foreign intermediary banks and typically takes 1-3 days, with service fees occurring at each stage. A case is mentioned where a couple acted as an illegal intermediary for overseas transfers, accepting large sums from foreign workers and charging them fees, illustrating the risk of such private, unregistered services.

The text is about illegal activities that violate the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, particularly in Vietnam. Mr. Kim and his wife charged a fee of 3,000 won for every 100 US dollars, earning a total of 108 million won. The text warns against the use of unauthorized brokers, known as "Hwanchigi", to send money abroad, as it can result in fraud or scams. Sending money through a bank teller is suggested as a safer alternative, although it may be more expensive and can only be done during bank hours. Fees can range from 5,000 to 20,000 won per transaction, with additional charges for cable or brokerage services. The text also suggests sending money via internet banking or mobile banking services as more convenient alternatives, but warns that identification is required to use these services.

The text provides instructions for sending money overseas using a bank. Initially, a visitor must bring their identification card to the bank and take a ticket at the foreign exchange window. Foreigners specifically must carry their passports. The sender is required to fill an application form with the necessary details (in English) such as sender's information, recipient's information and their bank details. 

Once the form has been filled, the sender then pays the remittance amount and the corresponding fees, which may include service fees, cable fees, and brokerage fees. After this process, it is vital for the sender to retain the transaction records and receipt as proof of transaction. 

Finally, before visiting the bank, it is advised that the sender double-checks the required documents and information needed for the process. The text makes a specific reference to using internet banking or mobile banking for sending the money abroad.

The summarized document outlines the required documents and information for remittance by foreign workers. Common documents include a passport and application form for foreign currency remittance. For remittance of remuneration by foreign workers, the requirements include a passport, employment contract, documents proving income in Korea, proof of income (when sending more than US$50,000 a year), and a certificate of tax payment. However, if sending less than US$50,000 a year, only a passport is needed.

The required sender's information includes name, address, and phone number while the recipient's information includes the same alongside bank information like the full bank name, bank address, country name, bank code, and the recipient account number. The sender should note that the money transfer might be delayed if the recipient's phone number is incomplete or omitted, and that the recipient's name and the account holder's name should match.

The text is about sending money abroad via online banking. A few required preparatory steps include setting up an online account, registering a withdrawal account, signing up for electronic financial services such as internet or mobile banking, designating your foreign exchange bank, registering foreign exchange customer information, installing a banking app, and issuing a certificate. One can visit a bank's website using a computer or tablet and process overseas remittances independently. Using internet banking services can reduce remittance fees by up to 50%. A note of caution included is that remittance does not happen immediately; it can take up to three business days depending on the country of destination. Providing accurate information like the recipient's account number, transaction bank, branch name, and country name is crucial to avoid delays.

The text is giving instructions on how to fill out a remittance application form. The first stage involves checking the transferring information, from which account you will be withdrawing the money, and who will be paying the remittance fee. You have to select the reason for your remittance (either remittance without any supporting documents, remittance of income earned in Korea, or remittance for studying abroad), the currency in which you want to send the money, select the bank account from which you want to withdraw money and enter the PIN, and designate who (sender or recipient) will pay the remittance brokerage fee. The second stage of the process requires you to enter sender and recipient information, including information about the recipient's bank.

The text provides instructions for overseas remittance through internet banking. The procedure includes three main stages: 

1. Enter details like the reason for remittance, the amount to be remitted, verify the account from which funds will be withdrawn, and designate who will pay the remittance brokerage fee (either sender or recipient).
 
2. Enter the sender's and recipient's information such as their name, phone number, and email. You will need to provide the recipient’s account number and address as well. Furthermore, enter the recipient's bank code or select the bank name, branch name, and destination country if the code is not known.

3. The final stage involves entering your internet banking certificate and confirming the transaction by entering your password. 

Additionally, if there is any information that you are unsure of, you can note it down and inquire about it from the bank staff during your next visit.

The text explains the process of exchanging and sending money abroad with Woori Bank's personal banking service. In stage 2, sender and recipient information as well as the recipient's bank details should be entered. In stage 3, after inputting the certificate PIN, the user should click the OK button. The processing order might vary for each bank. The bank also provides a service for sending money through internet and mobile banking. Customers can install the banking app on their own mobile device, such as their smartphone, and send money through the app. This process often reduces remittance fees by 50% or more compared to transacting at a bank. The process is almost the same as internet banking, except for the installation and login process on the mobile device.

The use of mobile banking services is on the rise as banks introduce simpler login methods, leading to a convenient transaction process. Users can now compare and check remittance fees for each bank in one place. Comparing fees and selecting a bank with the lowest fee as your foreign exchange bank can lead to extra benefits. It's also possible to handle foreign currency transfers through bank apps. Instructions include running the banking app, clicking on 'Remittance', and completing a remittance application form including details like reason for remittance, currency, account details, and who is paying the remittance fee.

The text provides a step-by-step guide on sending money abroad. The first step involves confirming the remittance information, withdrawal account, and deciding who will bear the remittance fee. The sender must select the type of remittance, input the currency type, amount, withdrawal account number, and password. In step two, the sender inputs their information in English including name, phone number, and email, as well as the recipient's information, and the recipient’s bank details. If the sender does not know the recipient’s bank code, they can select the recipient’s bank name, its branch name, and the destination country. In the third step, the sender inputs the certificate password for mobile banking and confirms the transaction to complete the remittance.

The text discusses the use of wire transfer services for sending money worldwide in under 10 minutes. Notable providers are Wester Union Company and MoneyGram and many domestic banks process remittances from these services. Some banks that handle Western Union include KB Kookmin Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, KEB Hana Bank, and others. Banks that handle MoneyGram include Woori Bank and Shinhan Bank among others. However, users must remember to compare service fees and exchange rates as these companies may charge more and apply less favorable rates than banks. Also, users should check the availability of the service in the destination city.

Additionally, ATM remittance services can be used after pre-registration. This includes recording of recent transactions and pre-registration of recipient’s bank information.

The text gives instructions on how to remit money overseas using an ATM. The steps involve choosing the recipient from pre-registered information or recent overseas remittance records, verifying the recipient's account number, selecting the desired currency and remittance amount, and then printing a receipt for proof of remittance. Additionally, the text discusses a personalized money transfer service offered by various banks that cater to diverse customer needs. This includes automatic remittance service for regular transfers, double/local currency service for recipients wanting to receive in local currency and accountless remittances made possible with fintech-based technologies.

The text talks about the availability of various remittance specialized services that utilize fintech technology, allowing for money transfers to over 200 countries worldwide without requiring a bank account and with low fees. However, each bank has different procedures, fees, and service names, so it is advised to reach out to your chosen bank before using these services. Small-sum money transfer services are highlighted as a means of sending money internationally, with advantages including cheaper fees and quicker transfer periods. However, when using fintech small-sum money transfer services, there are cautionary measures like ensuring transaction details to avoid misdirected transfers since retrieving wrongly transferred money might not be easy. It is advised to accurately enter and double-check the recipient's information before remitting the money.

The text offers various tips for using financial services, especially focusing on personalized money transfer services offered by banks. The services vary from bank to bank, including: 

- Automatic remittance, ideal for making regular payments to a specific recipient. Examples of banks providing this service include Shinhan Bank and Kookmin Bank.

- Overseas remittance without an account, suitable when the recipient doesn't have a bank account. For instance, Woori Bank and Kookmin Bank provide this service.

- Remittance in double/local currency – when the sender sends money in US dollars, but the recipient wishes to receive the amount in the local currency. IBK and Shinhan Bank offer this service.

- Real-time remittance, allowing recipients to receive sent money immediately. The bank's overseas branches aid in making the process quicker.

The text explains the different overseas remittance services offered by various banks. Services can vary in terms of the countries (regions) and currencies available, thus you need to, prior to initiating any transactions, contact your bank. Examples of these services include the KB Global Direct Remittance Service, Woori Quick Global Remittance, and PPCB Real-Time Remittance. Some banks offer preferential benefits based on transaction records and lower remittance fees for transactions in various local currencies. Fintech has enabled these banks to send money to up to 200 countries with lower fees through partnerships with foreign banks. Examples of such services include KB ONE ASIA overseas remittance, Hana ez overseas remittance, Woori Quick Global Remittance, and I-VARO remittance which offer varying benefits such as lower remittance fees and simple procedures for inputting recipient bank information.

The text provides advice on how to execute fintech small-sum money transfers safely due to the risk of fraudulent companies offering seemingly low fees. It recommends verifying whether the service provider is officially registered as a fintech small-sum money transfer company through the financial consumer information website FINE of FSS. The text instructs to access the Financial Supervisory Service website fine.fss.or.kr, click ‘Search for Fintech Small-sum Money Exchange and Transfer Service’ and check the status of the company. It also explains how to send money abroad through fintech small-sum money exchange and transfer service, which includes app installation, registration, and document submission.

The given text is a guide regarding how to send money to another account. The process requires the sender's and recipient's detailed identification and contact information, including, but not limited to, legal documents such as passports and resident cards, as well as a bank account number linked to the sender's name. The procedure proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, you need to input the sender's and recipient's information, including English name, phone number, email, account number, and address in English. The second stage involves entering the details of remittance, such as selecting currency type, remittance amount, and specifying the reason for remittance. There are typically three categories for the remittance reason: remittance not needing any supporting documents, remittance of income earned in Korea, and remittance for a student studying abroad. To finalize the transaction, you have to input the certificate PIN.

The text highlights 4 main points about handling money transactions abroad. Firstly, it's advised to check exchange rates either online, through internet banking, or by visiting a bank directly. Secondly, exchanging money through internet banking can offer preferential benefits, especially for large sums or currency other than US dollars. However, it is suggested to inquire in advance. Thirdly, remittance fees may be saved by using internet or mobile banking which can cut fees by up to 50%. Also, favorable exchange rates may be offered by your primary bank for remittances. Furthermore, services such as Fintech Small-sum Money Exchange and Transfer Service offer low-cost transfers within a limit of USD 5,000 per transaction and USD 50,000 per year. Lastly, one can send up to US$50,000 a year after registering foreign exchange information without further proof of income. However, beyond that limit, proof of income is necessary.

The text discusses various types of financial fraud, including phishing, pharming, smishing, loan fraud, insurance fraud, and illegal use of bank accounts. For each type, it explains the common characteristics and provides tips on how to prevent them. It also communicates a warning to foreigners to avoid being involved in withdrawing money related to voice phishing. Furthermore, it portrays a scenario where an investigator from the Public Prosecutor’s Office contacts a person named Susan, informing her about criminals attempting to misuse her account and asking for her cooperation for security measures.

Susan was contacted by a scammer pretending to be a detective, claiming that her account was used in a crime. Under the scammer's instruction, she entered her financial information into a phishing website disguised as the Prosecutor's Office's homepage. The scammer used this information to hijack 10 million won by reissuing a digital certification in Susan's name, withdrawing the money, and receiving card loans. The tip for remembering is that if a caller from any government agency asks for personal information, the caller is definitely a scammer. Government employees or financial Institutions will never ask for account information over the phone. Foreign residents often become scammers' targets as they are not familiar with such activities in Korea.

The text discusses financial fraud and voice phishing, which is a rampant issue in Korea. The damage cases reported daily in 2019 amounted to 1.84 billion won. The situation slightly improved in 2020 due to ongoing prevention methods and limitations put on criminal organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, foreign residents are still at high risk due to their limited financial knowledge in Korea.

Phishing is highlighted as the most common form of financial fraud. Phishing is a crime that uses telecommunications to deceive others and steal their properties. If committed via phone, it's known as voice phishing, and if through messenger applications, it's called 'Messenger phishing'. 

Voice phishing involves tricking people into giving out personal info over the phone. Initially, the most vulnerable were those lacking financial knowledge or information, but the fraud techniques have become more sophisticated over time. The text advises not revealing personal info such as identity number, account number, password, etc., over the phone in any situation to avoid becoming a victim of these scams.

The text discusses the increasing problem of financial fraud, in particular, voice phishing. It shows the rising amount of voice phishing damage over the years, from 168.2 billion won in 2017 to 672 billion won in 2021. It also warns that due to the development of fraudulent techniques, anyone, regardless of age, occupation or class, can become a victim. Fraudsters may use personal information they've obtained and discuss social issues to seem credible. Fraud tactics include impersonation of government or financial institutions, applying psychological pressure with fabricated stories, and manipulation of caller ID to appear legitimate. Thus, constant vigilance is needed to avoid becoming a victim.

In recent times, scammers have improved their skills, speaking fluent Korean and directly withdrawing or transferring money from the victim's account using acquired financial transaction information. Illegally acquired bank accounts are also used in frauds. To prevent such instances, one should never share personal or financial information if asked over the phone or internet, especially via a caller who requests a trip to an ATM to make transactions. There were cases where foreign workers were scammed by callers pretending to be from their home countries asking for emergency funds. It is also advised to have the contact information of your child's friends and teachers as a precaution against kidnapping scams.

The text provides advice on how to respond when receiving a potential scam call. If someone claims your child has been kidnapped, verify the situation by personally reaching out to those in close proximity to your child before taking any action. Personal and financially sensitive information should never be blindly provided over the phone. If scammers have prior knowledge of your financial circumstances, directly contact the institution they allege to represent for confirmation. In the event of falling victim to voice phishing, immediately request a suspension of payment through the National Police Agency call center and your respective financial institution. Lastly, be aware that phone numbers can be manipulated. Consequently, caution and skepticism should be practiced when receiving suspicious calls, even if they come from previously registered telebanking numbers.

The Financial Supervisory Service's Voice Phishing Keeper website enables users to experience the "voice of phishing scammers" and report instances of scam calls. As of December 2021, the website had registered 82 voices of scammers that have been reported multiple times, as well as 412 scammer voices reported by the general public. Another key tip to prevent financial fraud is avoiding involvement in voice phishing scams. Especially, many foreigners unknowingly participate in such scams after applying for jobs that require ATM withdrawals or money transfers. It is illegal to use another person's card or passbook for withdrawals or make deposits on someone else's behalf. Foreigners unfamiliar with Korean laws have been prosecuted and even deported for attempting to withdraw or deliver money from voice phishing scams.

The text provides a cautionary insight into different types of phishing scams. One case involves an individual, Mr. A, who was duped into a job that involved cash withdrawals and deliveries using payment cards from an unmanned delivery box, only to find out he was working for a voice phishing criminal organization. Another person, Ms. B, got a job on social media to internationally transfer money deposited into her account as per her manager's instructions. Later on, the bank suspended her account, and she found the social media platform used for contact had already been removed. The text also elaborates on the concept of Messenger Phishing, where hackers impersonate a user on platforms like KakaoTalk and send requests for urgent funds to family and friends. Additionally, a form of phishing wherein fraudsters mimic financial institutions or the Financial Supervisory Service to send text messages luring people into phishing sites is described.

The text discusses various methods of financial fraud and how to prevent them. Scammers may direct you to a fake webpage, asking for personal information which they then use to swindle money by obtaining loans in your name. In other cases, scammers may impersonate a loved one through text messages, asking that you urgently send money or personal documents. They would then use this information to open bank accounts or receive loans in your name. A case is shared where Mr. K was scammed by a message from what he believed was his friend needing money for his sick child. To prevent such scams from occurring, the text advises not to install or click on suspicious applications or URLs, halt conversations requesting money, and confirm via direct phone calls, and never share personal and identification information via text messages.

The text provides advice on how to handle-request for personal information, money requests, payment of unused credit card, and suspicious messages. It warns to refuse providing ID and personal information, reject demands for money for upgrading credit rating or paying loan fee, validate unused credit card payment with the card issuer, and delete suspicious messages without opening. The text also mentions about a type of financial fraud called Pharming, where a user is tricked into entering their financial details on a fake internet banking site through a malicious program. It advises to never enter the relevant data and close the site immediately if encountered with such a scenario. Legitimate websites of financial institutions or public agencies never ask for security code, hence one should never provide it when asked.

The text highlights measures to limit financial fraud:

1. Input the required financial data.
2. Do not open or click on attachments from unidentified or suspicious sources.
3. Using One-time Passwords (OTP) increase security, and passwords should be changed regularly.
4. Signing up for the "electronic financial fraud prevention service" provided by banks can help to prevent financial scams.
5. Regularly check and remove malicious codes.

It also defines 'smishing' as a financial scam that sends large numbers of text messages containing malicious apps or programs to trick users into installing them. A cautionary tale is presented about an immigrant woman, Ms. L, who was deceived by a scam on her bank's website and lost all her money within an hour.

The Electronic Financial Fraud Prevention Service is a system that safeguards important financial transactions from electronic fraud through additional security checks. It includes two main services: (1) User Terminal Designation Service, which allows the user to register up to 5 transaction devices such as PCs and smartphones. Once a device is verified, no additional check is required on that device. (2) Additional security check service, where additional verification is done during financial transactions. This is typically used when reissuing a digital certificate, registering an external bank's certificate, or when transferring more than three million Korean won in one day online. These services are available for all individuals who use internet banking. Smishing scams are also discussed, which involve malicious texts disguised as various notifications prompting individuals to install harmful applications or make phone calls, thus leading to the theft of personal information and micropayment details.

The text emphasizes the importance of being cautious in dealing with suspicious text messages that might lead to financial fraud. It underscores not clicking on any internet address or phone number whose source is unconfirmed, usually hidden in texts disguised as invitations or offers. It shares the adverse experience of a woman who fell victim to financial loss after clicking on a malicious link in a text from a friend. Guidelines for preventing such incidents include reinforcing security settings on smartphones to prevent arbitrary installation of apps from unknown sources, regularly installing and updating antivirus programs, refraining from providing any personal or financial information, and blocking micropayment services if not in use.

The text is a guide providing advice on how to prevent financial fraud and handle it if you become a victim. It suggests that if you think you've been scammed, immediately suspend all payment activities on your account, and contact the following: the call center of your financial company, Financial Supervisory Service for consultation and refunds, National Police Agency to report the scam and request payment suspension, Korea Internet and Security Agency to report phishing and spam activities, and Korea Legal Aid Corporation for civil litigation procedures related to returning the phishing fraud damage. It also warns about loan fraud scammers who pretend to be employees from well-known financial companies.

The text discusses different tactics scammers use in attempts to commit loan fraud. These include sending messages at random, pretending to offer low-interest loans, and demanding the recipient's personal information when they respond. Scammers also impersonate banks or government institutions, offering loans with lower interest without any conditions, and then ask for money to be transferred for the payment of a high-interest loan. They further ask for payment of guarantee and data processing fees, claiming these are necessary due to low credit scores and to delete bad credit information. Lastly, they request recipients to send personal information like phone numbers, photocopies of bankbooks, and check card numbers, claiming they are necessary for obtaining a loan.

The text provides guidelines on how to prevent financial fraud. Key points include never sharing personal information like phone numbers, bankbook, or debit card details, as they can be used in scams. When dealing with loans, block spammers, and be wary of anyone asking for a fee or charges before loan processing as this could be a scam. It tells a cautionary tale of Mr. K who was conned into transferring a loan amount with a promise of lower interest rates. Lastly, the text warns against financial fraud involving illegally obtained bank accounts, though it doesn't elaborate on this point.

The text is about scammers using fraudulent bank accounts, typically in someone else's name, to collect money from victims of various crimes such as voice phishing. These accounts are used as they allow scammers to evade tracking by investigative agencies. In recent times, scammers have been collecting such accounts through various fraudulent means. The account holder can be subject to several disadvantages like suspension of payment, restrictions on online and mobile banking transactions, and limitations on opening new accounts. Additionally, anyone who transfers or lends their account could face up to five years in prison and hefty fines. It is likewise illegal to transfer or lend check cards and cash cards. Some scammers manipulate people into lending or transferring their bank account by promising short-term high profit, which is a type of financial fraud.

Scammers are using various tactics to defraud people through financial means. Through social media and part-time job sites, they convince individuals to lend their bank accounts, pretending to need it for purchasing or currency exchange. When contacted, they introduce themselves as purchasing agents for currency exchange or tax reduction and request personal information like the person's ID card and account number. They might ask the person to transfer certain amounts into their accounts and then withdraw it. 

Scammers also deceive people by convincing them they will offer a loan, using their bank accounts for illegal activities. They pose as financial companies and contact individuals who need a loan, asking them to increase transactions (deposits and withdrawals) to improve their credit rating.

In another tactic, scammers approach people claiming that money was transferred to their account mistakenly, and request a re-transfer.

An example is given with Mr. K, a man in his 20s, who got a part-time job through a job search site. The scammer introduced the job as a purchasing agent and obtained Mr. K's bank account number, later requesting him to retransfer money deposited into his account or withdraw it in cash.

The text discusses a case where voice phishing victims had money swindled from them. Mr. K, registered as the holder of the illegally obtained bank account, suffered damage due to the financial transaction. The text then offers methods to prevent financial fraud using illegally obtained bank accounts. These prevention measures include refusing requests to lend or transfer bank details, not processing re-transfers or withdrawals from unfamiliar sources, denying requests for personal information and using personal information exposure accident prevention systems provided by official financial agencies.

Insurance fraud refers to the act of deceiving insurance companies to claim money dishonestly. This can include withholding important information like health history when buying a policy, or giving false information. It also includes intentional acts causing personal injury or accidents, as well as exaggerated claims such as receiving excessive treatment or extending recovery periods to receive greater payouts. Accordingly, insurance fraud possesses certain characteristics. It tends to be complex and diverse, often involving serious crimes like murder or arson to claim insurance benefits. It's often carried out by accomplices and is becoming increasingly organized and sophisticated.

The text discusses the increasing sophistication of insurance fraud, with many groups involved. These groups, including organized criminal organizations, hospitals, clinics, maintenance shops, and taxi drivers, commit fraud by intentionally causing car accidents, particularly against vehicles violating traffic rules. The fraud involves claiming insurance through false diagnoses and hospitalizations in collusion with brokers, or exaggerating damage and pain after vehicular accidents. They also use rental cars or two-wheeled vehicles to intentionally cause accidents. To prevent becoming a victim of fraud, one is advised to be suspicious and refuse any engagement in an illegal act when promised a high daily wage.

The text covers the issue of insurance fraud. One must not submit false claims to insurance companies, even for small amounts, as it is fraudulent behavior. If you suspect or are a victim of insurance fraud, you should report it to the Financial Supervisory Service or your insurance company. A case is given of an individual who didn't disclose his medical history when signing an insurance contract which is considered as potential insurance fraud showing the importance of full disclosure when applying for insurance. In case of fraudulent activity, victims must report it to their corresponding insurance company or the 'Insurance Fraud Report Center' run by the Financial Supervisory Service. The text provides contact details of the report center including the telephone number, fax and website.

The text provided lists the names, call center numbers, and websites of various life insurance and non-life insurance companies in Korea.

It then provides advice on how to avoid financial scams. These tips include understanding what scams look like (especially since they are becoming increasingly sophisticated with increased smartphone and internet usage), and the importance of not revealing personal information. If you are a victim of a financial scam, contact the police or your financial company immediately. The text also warns against lending your bankbook to others as this is illegal and could lead to scams.

The text warns against loaning bank accounts due to the high risk of scams and consequent legal and financial responsibilities.
