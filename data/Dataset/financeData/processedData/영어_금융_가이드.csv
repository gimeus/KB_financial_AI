This structured overview aims to provide readers with essential know-how for handling everyday financial transactions safely and effectively. The text provides an extensive guide on financial fraud and banking services, focusing heavily on types of financial scams and preventative measures. It outlines various fraud types such as voice phishing, messenger phishing, pharming, smishing, loan fraud, and fraud involving illegally obtained bank accounts. For each type, common characteristics and prevention tips are shared. Additionally, it covers characteristics and prevention of insurance fraud.

The text also includes practical information for foreigners, including lists of bank branches with dedicated services for foreigners, banks with foreign-language-supported ATMs, and customer service phone numbers for banks and credit card companies in various languages. Furthermore, it explains basic banking services like opening accounts, using bank tellers, ATMs, internet and mobile banking, and paying utility bills, illustrated with a personal anecdote about a monetary exchange mix-up. The text discusses various challenges and experiences related to using banking services, particularly for someone unfamiliar with local currency and modern banking methods. It narrates issues like trouble calculating prices abroad due to unfamiliarity with foreign currency, and the difficulties of managing banking tasks during work hours. The conversation suggests utilizing internet and mobile banking instead, despite initial hesitations about needing a digital certificate. The bank can assist with setting up these services. Concerns include accidental money transfers to the wrong person and general questions about financial services in Korea. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding and confidently using basic and digital banking services, and provides a brief overview of banknotes in Korea. The text provides an overview of Korean currency denominations, including coins (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 won) and banknotes (1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 won). It discusses the cost of typical consumer goods in Korea, such as bus fare (1,200-1,600 won), snacks (1,000-2,000 won), inexpensive restaurant meals (6,000-10,000 won), and a 20kg bag of rice (50,000-60,000 won).

The text also outlines banking services in Korea, advising foreign workers and multicultural families to keep their money in financial institutions for safety and to earn interest. It explains that financial institutions in Korea are divided into banks and non-bank financial institutions, with banks offering various services such as deposits, withdrawals, loans, remittances, and currency exchange. The text explains the various financial services available in Korea, primarily through banks and other financial institutions. Banks offer essential services such as depositing and withdrawing money, lending, currency exchange, card issuance, and bill payment. In addition to banks, there are non-bank financial institutions like mutual savings banks, community credit cooperatives, credit unions, agricultural cooperatives (Nonghyup), fisheries cooperatives (Suhyup), and Korea Post, which provide similar services but usually with higher interest rates on deposits and loans. With the rise of internet and mobile banking, it's still advisable to visit a nearby financial institution for certain transactions or assistance. Other frequently used financial institutions include insurance companies, securities companies, and credit card companies.

Further, there are institutions like the Bank of Korea, which is the central bank responsible for issuing money and controlling its circulation, and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), which supervises financial companies to ensure fair practices and protect consumers. The FSS also provides useful information and addresses consumer grievances in the financial sector. The text provides practical advice for financial consumers, focusing on the benefits of choosing a primary bank for personal banking needs. It suggests concentrating transactions with one bank to gain special benefits such as fee waivers and better interest rates, especially for foreign workers and multicultural families. The text also recommends consulting with multiple banks before making a decision and highlights the advantages of family members using the same bank. Additionally, it explains the process of opening a bank account. To open an account, you need to visit a bank, and bring your ID card and documents proving your financial activities, such as business registration for business operators, employment certificates for workers, and enrollment certificates for students. The text provides guidelines for safe financial transactions, emphasizing the importance of protecting your PIN. A PIN based on easily guessable information like an ID number, phone number, or birth date is vulnerable to hacking. Users should not write down their PIN or share it with others. It is crucial to never let others use your bank account, as doing so can lead to criminal charges, especially if the account is used for illegal activities. If you lose your bankbook, name seal, or cash card, report it immediately to the bank and follow their instructions.

To open a bank account, you need to bring identification (passport, alien registration card, or resident registration card), a name seal or signature, and documents proving the purpose of the financial transaction. Upon arrival at the bank, take a number from the ticket dispenser and wait for your turn. Inform the teller that you want to open an account and, if necessary, request internet banking and a cash withdrawal card. The text is about the process of opening a bank account and conducting transactions both with bank tellers and through ATMs. When opening a bank account, you need to inform the bank teller, fill out an application providing details such as your resident registration number, birth date, address, and phone number, create a PIN, and keep your bankbook and cash withdrawal card safe.

For transactions with a bank teller, you take a number, fill out an application form for the transaction type (e.g., remittance, deposit, withdrawal), seal or sign it, and submit it at the teller’s counter when your number is called. Bank teller consultations allow you to ask questions and ensure the accuracy of transactions, but can only be done within banking hours (9 a.m. to 4 p.m.). For simple transactions, using an ATM is more convenient as they operate beyond banking hours and can save fees.

ATMs allow you to perform various banking tasks like deposits, withdrawals, remittances, checking account statements, and updating bankbooks without a bank teller, and most provide services in multiple languages. The text provides instructions for using ATMs in Korea, including steps for withdrawal, deposit, and money transfer. It highlights that ATMs support multiple languages, making them accessible to non-Korean speakers. Users should be cautious when entering their PIN to ensure privacy. For withdrawals, users need to insert their bankbook or cash card, press the withdrawal button, and enter their PIN, with options to withdraw in different denominations or checks. Deposits follow similar steps, though coins and smaller bills typically can't be used. For money transfers, selecting the appropriate button and confirming the recipient's details is essential, and transfers to different banks may incur fees.

Additionally, the text offers practical tips for saving on fees by using ATMs from one's primary bank during banking hours and explains the withdrawal limits, varying slightly by bank but generally up to 700,000–1,000,000 won per transaction and a daily limit of around 6,000,000 won. The text provides step-by-step instructions on how to withdraw cash and transfer money using an ATM in Korea.

### Withdrawing Cash:
1. **Insert Card or Bankbook**: Insert your cash card or bankbook into the appropriate ATM slot.
2. **Select 'Cash Withdrawal'**: Press or tap the 'Cash Withdrawal' button, which may be labeled differently depending on the machine.
3. **Enter PIN**: Enter your personal identification number discreetly.
4. **Enter Amount**: Specify the amount you wish to withdraw.
5. **Choose Denomination**: Select your preferred bill denominations (10,000 won or 50,000 won).
6. **Confirm Amount and Denomination**: Verify the displayed amount and denominations, then confirm or cancel if incorrect.
7. **Print Receipt**: Opt to print a transaction receipt if needed.
8. **Confirm Withdrawal**: Ensure that the withdrawn amount matches your request.

### Transferring Money:
1. **Insert Card or Bankbook**: Place your card or bankbook in the respective slot.
2. **Select 'Send'**: Press or tap the 'Send' button, which can also appear as 'Remittance,' 'Transfer,' or 'Transfer Work.'
3. **Enter PIN**: Input your PIN carefully to prevent others from seeing it.

The daily withdrawal limit is around 6 million won, so for larger amounts, visiting a bank is recommended. The text provides detailed instructions for using an ATM for various banking transactions, including sending money, checking account balances, and updating bankbooks. Here are the summarized steps:

1. **Sending Money**:
   - Select the bank for the transfer.
   - Enter the recipient's account number without any hyphens.
   - Input and confirm the transfer amount by checking the recipient's name, account number, and the amount.
   - Print a receipt for detailed transaction information.

2. **Checking Account**:
   - Insert your cash card or bankbook and press the [Check] button (which may be labeled differently in English) to view your balance and transaction history (deposits and withdrawals).

3. **Updating Bankbook**:
   - Insert your bankbook into the ATM and press the [Update] button to print the latest transaction records into your bankbook.

The text also mentions that ATMs now provide a ""foreign languages"" button, which can be helpful for users unfamiliar with the local language. The text explains the convenience and steps involved in using internet banking services. It highlights the support for various languages, such as English and Vietnamese, which enhances user friendliness by allowing the screen interface to be displayed in the user's native language. This improvement in user experience extends to ATMs as well.

For signing up for internet banking, first visit your bank with an acceptable form of personal identification and apply for the service. It's suggested to sign up for internet banking when opening a bank account. Before visiting, it may be helpful to decide on an ID for access. After application, you need to download a Personal Digital Certificate from the bank's website. Some banks offer internet banking in multiple languages, providing additional convenience. This text provides guidelines on how to use banking services, particularly focusing on setting up internet banking. Here is a summary:

1. **Account Visit**: Take a ticket, wait for your turn, fill out the application form, and create your user ID with the help of a bank employee.
2. **Setting PIN and Transfer Limits**: Establish a PIN for money transfers and set daily and one-time maximum transfer limits.
3. **Security Code Card or OTP**: Choose either a Security Code Card or an OTP for internet banking passwords to prevent fraud and unauthorized access.
4. **Electronic Passbook**: Using an electronic passbook offers benefits like reduced fees and better interest rates, especially if you primarily use internet or mobile banking.

Additionally, tips for financial services indicate that opting for an electronic bankbook can provide preferential incentives, making it beneficial for those planning to use digital banking methods. The text describes different security measures used in internet banking. 

1. **Security Code Card**: This card, similar in size to a business card, contains 30-35 pre-printed four-digit security codes. During internet banking, you are required to input specific digits from the card upon request. These cards are typically issued for free but are considered less secure since the codes are static and printed in advance.

2. **One Time Password (OTP)**: OTP is an electronic device that generates a unique six-digit code for each transaction. Since the code changes each time and is valid for a single transaction, it offers greater security compared to security code cards. An OTP device issued by one bank can be used for transactions at multiple banks.

3. **Precautions**: Both security code cards and OTP devices should never be shared with others. In the event of loss, it is crucial to report it to the bank immediately for cancellation and reissuance.

4. **Digital and Financial Certificates**: Similar to showing ID and verifying one's identity in-person at a bank, internet banking requires electronic certificates to prove the identity of the user. Until 2020, the ""Personal digital certificate"" was the only such electronic verification method. The text provides a guide on how to use digital certificates (formerly known as electronic certificates) and financial certificates for internet banking. It explains the process of selecting and issuing one of these certificates. The term ""digital certificate"" now replaces the old ""personal digital certificate.""

Additionally, the text offers a tip for banking security: signing up for a bank’s text message service (SMS) or App Push Service to receive notifications of transactions. This allows users to monitor their account activity and quickly report any unauthorized transactions to the bank or police (☎112). The App Push Service is highlighted as free, unlike the SMS service which may incur a fee.

The document also outlines the steps and necessary items for obtaining a digital certificate, such as user ID, account number, PIN, and a security code card or OTP. The detailed procedure involves logging in to the bank’s website and navigating to the digital certificate menu to issue or reissue a certificate. This document explains the process of obtaining a digital certificate, focusing on banking, credit card, and insurance use. Issuance of the certificate is free and involves multiple steps:

1. **Selection**: Choose the certificate type.
2. **Consent**: Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
3. **Identity Verification**: Confirm your identity by entering personal details like your resident registration number, account number, PIN, and security code.
4. **Password and Storage**: Create a secure password for your certificate and decide where to store it, preferably on a portable storage device for better security.

The text also introduces financial certificates, jointly developed by Korean banks and the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute (KFTC). Financial certificates serve similar purposes as digital certificates but are stored in the KFTC's cloud, eliminating the need for a USB or additional security programs. They are valid for three years and use a simpler six-digit PIN. The steps to obtain a financial certificate are similar to those for a digital certificate. The text provides information on using internet banking services. It explains how to log in and issue a financial certificate by visiting the bank's website. It also describes how to check account activities online using a digital or financial certificate, specifying that users can see transaction history for chosen periods (e.g., one week, one month). The text emphasizes the importance of storing digital certificates on portable storage devices (like USBs) for security and advises against using shared computers (e.g., in internet cafes) to avoid hacking. Additionally, it covers sending money to different accounts, noting that transfers within the same bank are usually free, while transfers to other banks may incur fees, which some banks might waive under certain conditions. It also warns that entering wrong passwords multiple times can disable the internet banking service, requiring a visit to the bank for resolution. The text provides detailed instructions on how to use internet banking to transfer money to another account. Key steps are highlighted:

1. **Accessing the Bank Website**: Visit the bank's website.
2. **Logging In**: Use a digital certificate and its password to login.
3. **Entering Transfer Information**: Click on [Money Transfer], then input the sender's and recipient's account details including the bank, account number, and the transfer amount.
4. **Verifying Information**: Review and verify the entered information before proceeding.
5. **Entering Passwords**: Input the required passwords for authorization, including digital certificate passwords and security codes.
6. **Security Tip**: It's safer to enter passwords using a virtual keypad with a mouse to avoid hacking risks.

Additionally, it advises a thorough check of the recipient’s details to avoid transferring money to the wrong account. To avoid mistakes during money transfers, you can use a ""transfer-delay service,"" which ensures money is transferred at least three hours after the order is placed. This allows time to cancel any incorrect transactions before they are processed. You can apply for this service either online or by visiting a bank branch. If the money has already been transferred, you should contact the bank to request a refund. If the recipient agrees, the money can be returned. If not, or if there are legal issues, you can seek help from the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation's “Scheme to Support Return of Misdirected Money Transfer” by contacting their call center.

Additionally, mobile banking allows for performing most banking tasks, such as account checking, money transfer, and bill payments, through smartphones or tablets. To use mobile banking, you must be registered for internet banking, install the bank’s app, and download a certificate on your device. The text provides detailed instructions on various banking operations, emphasizing how to manage digital certificates for internet banking. 

1. **Accessing Digital Certificates on Bank Websites:**
   - On a bank's website, you can find the Digital Certificate Center which explains how to download or copy digital certificates to smartphones.
   - If you use a cloud-stored financial certificate, no additional procedures are required to use it on a smartphone.

2. **Tips for Using Financial Services:**
   - When changing smartphones, back up your digital certificate in advance to avoid issues with mobile banking.
   - If the smartphone is changed or reset without backing up, the digital certificate could be deleted, complicating financial transactions.

3. **Copying Digital Certificates from PC to Smartphone:**
   - **On a Smartphone:**
     - Run the mobile banking app and navigate to the 'Digital Certificate Center' and 'Retrieve from PC' menus.
   - **On a PC:**
     - Log in to the bank's website and access the Digital Certificate Center.
     - Select the options to copy the certificate to the smartphone.
   - **Steps:**
     - Choose the certificate you want to copy.
     - Enter the PIN, either the generated PIN or by scanning a QR code on the PC screen.

These instructions help ensure seamless use of mobile banking services by properly managing digital certificates. The text provides a guide on managing banking tasks, with a focus on paying utility bills. It begins with instructions on copying a certificate from a PC to a smartphone using a QR code. It then explains what a utility bill is, which includes charges for electricity, water, gas, and phone usage, and emphasizes the importance of paying these bills on time to avoid additional fees and potential service cutoffs. It suggests ensuring that your mailing address is current to avoid missing bills and recommends receiving bills digitally to prevent issues. The guide concludes with steps for paying utility bills using internet or mobile banking, highlighting the convenience of these methods. The text provides instructions on how to use mobile and internet banking to pay utility bills in Korea. It highlights three methods:

1. **Payment through Giro on the Internet**: Users can visit the Giro homepage (www.giro.or.kr) managed by the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute to pay bills from home using the internet or a smartphone.
2. **Automatic Withdrawal**: This method allows for automatic payment of utility bills from the user's bank account on a designated date each month, ensuring convenience but cautioning users to maintain sufficient funds to avoid late fees. It can be set up by visiting a bank or via internet or mobile banking.
3. **Steps for Paying Utility Bills on Giro Homepage**: 
   - Visit the bank or Giro homepage.
   - Log in with a digital certificate.
   - Enter the customer or Giro number from the utility bill.
   - Enter the payment account details, including the account owner's registration number and PIN.
   - Confirm the payment.

Additionally, there is a handy tip suggesting the use of automatic withdrawal or transfer reservation services for convenience. The text provides guidance on payment services for bills and fees. It mentions the convenience of using an automatic withdrawal service to periodically transfer money for utility bills, rent, pocket money, and membership fees to a designated account. For non-periodic payments on specific dates, a transfer reservation service is available.

Additionally, it discusses using a special bill-paying machine at banks for utility bill payments. To use this machine, bring a bankbook or payment card and the utility bill. Steps include separating the customer receipt, inserting the utility bill into the machine, selecting the bankbook or card for payment, and keeping the receipt as proof of payment. It also suggests visiting your primary bank to avoid fees.

Lastly, it describes the option of paying utility bills at a bank teller or post office by showing the bill statement and informing the staff of your intention to pay. The text provides financial wisdom and tips for utilizing banking services effectively. It narrates the case of 'B', a married immigrant woman who works during the day and couldn't frequently visit the bank, leading her to incur a late fee on her utility bills. To avoid future late fees, she signed up for an automatic bill payment service. However, one month, due to insufficient funds in her account, the payment for two months' bills, including an additional late fee, was deducted at once the following month when funds were available.

The text also offers handy tips, such as contacting the utility company if you lose your bill statement to obtain necessary payment details and keeping receipts as proof of payment.

Finally, it emphasizes the convenience of using bank services. Banks handle almost all money-related services, including deposits, withdrawals, loans, and currency exchanges, providing safety and interest on deposits. For those who cannot visit the bank, using ATMs, internet banking, or mobile banking is recommended for performing various transactions outside of bank hours with favorable commissions and interest rates. Here's a summary of the text:

Banking services can be accessed through various channels such as internet banking, mobile banking, and ATMs, which allow for transactions outside of regular banking hours. Non-Korean speakers can also access banking services through interpretation services available at certain branches and call centers with foreign language support. Utility bills can be paid via internet banking, mobile banking, Giro homepage, automatic withdrawal, or in person at a bank or post office. Notifications for bills can be received by mail, email, or text message. Additionally, there are various savings products one can use, such as fixed savings deposits, tax-benefit savings, and savings accounts for apartment purchases, all of which are protected under a depositor protection system. The text also touches upon the experience of renewing a house rental contract, explaining the right to renew a jeonse (two-year lease) rental agreement for an additional two years. The text discusses the renewal of a Jeonse (a Korean rental deposit system) contract and the possibility for the landlord to raise the deposit by up to 5%. The writer reflects on the financial burden this might cause and explains how they fortunately managed to cover this increase with their fixed installment savings. The text then elaborates on the benefits of saving money, especially through fixed installment savings which offer higher interest rates. It highlights the need for savings to prepare for unexpected events like medical emergencies, education costs, or deposit increases. The text also suggests opening a housing subscription savings account for those interested in purchasing a new apartment, noting that even foreign residents can do so. It concludes with advice on setting a savings plan, emphasizing the importance of saving a portion of income before spending to ensure consistent savings. To summarize the given text:

The text provides advice on saving money, emphasizing the use of fixed installment savings or fixed deposits to accumulate large sums, particularly for marriage immigrants who may find banks offering high-interest savings products tailored to them. Visiting banks with necessary documents and consulting staff is recommended.

A personal story is shared where a woman from the Philippines who moved to Korea 15 years ago through marriage faced financial struggles after her husband suffered a brain hemorrhage and she was diagnosed with breast cancer. With hospital bills and living expenses straining her budget, she regrets not having saved or insured herself earlier. 

Experts advise saving 20-30% of income for unforeseen circumstances. The text explains different savings products in Korea, such as fixed savings deposits, fixed installment savings, and free savings accounts, detailing how each works and their benefits. The text provides information on various savings options and tips for maximizing interest returns. It explains that a free savings account allows you to deposit money flexibly before maturity with typically higher interest rates than fixed savings deposits but lower than installment savings. Due to continually changing interest rates, it recommends regularly checking and selecting the most favorable savings plan. It also notes that internet-only banks and online-only bank products usually offer higher interest rates than traditional banks and that savings banks generally provide better rates than commercial banks. 

The text distinguishes between fixed savings deposits (a large sum deposited for a set period) and fixed installment savings (regular monthly deposits). It advises to maintain accounts until maturity to avoid losing interest and highlights the importance of choosing a savings plan that fits one's financial situation. 

For better interest rates, it advises checking the “Financial Products at a Glance” section on the financial information network ""FINE"" (fine.fss.or.kr). Some banks offer promotional products with additional interest rates, which may not be listed on the PINE website. Therefore, it's beneficial to search online for such offers. When opening an account, banks may give extra preferential interest rates based on your transaction activities. It's usually advantageous to use one primary bank. For those over 65 years old, there are tax-free savings accounts available.

If you need a large sum of money after opening an account, consider using a savings deposit or installment savings mortgage loan instead of withdrawing your funds early, as these loans typically have lower interest rates and no fees for early repayment before maturity.

To save money, look for savings products with tax benefits, as taxes on interest income can make the earned interest seem lower. Common providers of tax-free or tax-favored savings accounts include credit unions and cooperative associations. Joining as a member can give you access to these accounts. Employees and entrepreneurs can also leverage Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) offered by banks and securities firms for tax benefits. The text discusses financial products and savings accounts related to tax benefits and apartment purchases in Korea.

1. **ISA (Individual Savings Account)**:
    - Income tax benefits are available for incomes ranging from 2 to 4 million won.
    - ISA allows investments in funds, deposits, and installment savings.
    - To receive tax benefits, investments must be held for at least three years.
    - Periodic fees may apply; it's important to review the conditions before signing up.

2. **Housing Subscription Savings Account**:
    - Required for applying for new apartment purchases.
    - Open to both Korean citizens and foreign residents, with foreigners ineligible for year-end tax returns.
    - Foreign residents need their alien registration card to open an account.
    - Multi-cultural families with a foreign spouse may acquire an apartment without bidding if they meet certain conditions: living with the spouse at the same address for over three years and proving all family members do not own a house.
    - Deposit amounts range from 20,000 to 500,000 won per month.
    - Interest rates vary based on the deposit period, with different rates for less than one month, one month to a year, one to two years, and more than two years.
    - Preferences are given to families living in rented homes, without home ownership, who have held the account for more than one year and made at least 12 monthly deposits. 

This summary includes the essential points about eligibility, benefits, and conditions for both types of accounts. ### Summary:

**Subscription Shrinking Areas**:
1. Priority for housing subscriptions is given to non-homeowners who have maintained a housing subscription savings account for over a year, with at least 12 monthly deposits. This excludes the Seoul Metropolitan Area, speculative and overheated regions, and shrinking areas.

**Depositor Protection System**:
- Foreign residents sometimes hesitate to use banks for fear of losing money if the bank fails. In Korea, the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation (KDIC) ensures up to 50 million won per bank, including both principal and interest.
- Depositors with large amounts should spread their deposits across multiple banks.
- Not all financial products, such as funds, are protected by the depositor protection scheme. It’s vital to verify whether a product is covered.
- Checking the protection status can be done on the KDIC website (https://www.kdic.or.kr) or by consulting a bank representative.

**Increasing Savings Returns**:
1. Compare interest rates of various savings products on the Financial Supervisory Service's website (FINE) to maximize returns. Benefits such as preferential rates may be available by choosing savings products from one's primary bank.
2. When needing a large sum urgently, consider partially terminating the savings product or opting for a savings-based mortgage loan instead of full termination. The text provides an overview of various financial products and services, particularly focusing on saving and payment options available in a mutual financial association.

1. **Savings Products with Tax Benefits:** 
   - You can obtain tax-favored benefits by investing in savings products offered by mutual financial associations.
   - The Individual Savings Account (ISA) allows tax-free income up to 4 million won.
   - Individuals aged 65 and over can join a tax-free savings plan where interest is not taxed.

2. **Housing Subscription Savings Account:** 
   - This account enables you to purchase a newly built apartment. 
   - Households with a foreign spouse may qualify to purchase an apartment without bidding if they have lived at the same address for over three years and do not own a house as of the subscription date.

3. **Deposit Protection:** 
   - Deposits are protected up to 50 million won, covering both principal and interest, even if the bank goes bankrupt. 
   - It's advised to distribute large amounts across several banks for better security.

4. **Using Payment Cards:**
   - Explanation and precautions for using check and credit cards.

5. **Conversational Example:** 
   - A dialogue shows the consideration of using a credit card for a pricey purchase by taking advantage of installment payments, reflecting daily financial decision-making scenarios.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of utilizing tax benefits, securing deposits, and managing payment cards prudently to improve financial well-being. The text discusses the benefits and drawbacks of using check cards versus credit cards. One person shares that they almost missed a credit card payment last month and prefers using a check card because money is deducted from their account immediately after making a purchase. Another person agrees, acknowledging that using a credit card leads to overspending. It also suggests that spending with cash can help control expenses due to the psychological impact of seeing money diminish, whereas credit cards reduce awareness of spending, increasing the risk of overspending. The text advises developing planned spending habits when using credit cards and offers a section on using payment cards wisely, detailing the benefits of check cards and credit cards in Korea. The text provides a comparison between personal credit limits and check cards, highlighting their features and usage. Personal credit cards allow for installment payments, cash advances, and scheduled monthly payments, whereas check cards deduct money directly from a bank account at the time of purchase. The text also details precautions for using check cards, such as maintaining a sufficient account balance, signing up for SMS usage alerts, and promptly reporting lost cards to prevent misuse. An example is given of a foreign worker who prevented further unauthorized transactions by using SMS alerts. Finally, the text stresses the importance of signing the card and reporting its loss immediately. The text provides guidelines on the use and precautions of credit and check cards in Korea. It emphasizes the importance of signing the card and reporting it immediately if lost to prevent misuse. Lending or transferring the card to others can result in uncompensated damages. Credit cards allow purchases with deferred payment, involving the card company which pays upfront and the user repaying later. The issuance process for credit cards includes verification of credit risk, which is more stringent than for check cards, requiring proof of residency, employment, assets, and financial history. For newly arrived foreign spouses, a family card based on the spouse's credit score might be an option. Additionally, credit cards offer benefits such as discounts and installment payments without interest, which should be chosen based on individual lifestyle. The text ends with a financial scenario involving a person named 'A' who sought a bank loan after being asked to increase the rental deposit by her landlord. The text discusses the impacts of missing credit card payments and provides tips on using credit cards responsibly. It starts with an anecdote about a woman who couldn't secure a bank loan due to her low credit score from a missed credit card payment. Consequently, she had to pay higher monthly rent and realized for the first time how credit card defaults affect loan eligibility.

It also differentiates between credit cards and check cards, highlighting that credit cards allow for installment payments for large purchases. However, installment fees are generally higher than savings deposit interest rates, so it's crucial to check fees beforehand.

The text advises reporting lost credit cards immediately and signing on the back of the card for compensation purposes.

Additionally, it mentions that credit cards can provide cash advances or card loans but warns that these come with higher interest rates than regular loans and can harm credit scores if used frequently. Users are advised to consider if the funds are genuinely necessary before taking such loans.

Lastly, the text emphasizes the importance of timely credit card bill payments to avoid late fees and negative impacts on future creditworthiness. The text provides guidelines on using credit and check cards responsibly to avoid financial difficulties. Key points include:

1. **Credit Card Usage**:
   - Limit the number of credit cards to one or two to simplify tracking and management.
   - Adjust credit card limits to match your income and living expenses to avoid overspending.
   - Be cautious with credit card usage to avoid high-interest charges and financial penalties for late payments.

2. **Check Cards**:
   - Consider using check cards to stick to a budget, as purchases withdraw money directly from your bank account.
   - Always check your account balance before using a check card to ensure sufficient funds.

3. **Securing PINs**:
   - Keep payment card PINs confidential and avoid using easily guessed information like birth dates or phone numbers.

4. **Timely Payments**:
   - Pay credit card bills on time to prevent late fees and negative marks on your credit history, which can affect future financial transactions.

5. **Lost Cards**:
   - Report lost cards immediately to cancel them and prevent unauthorized use. The text provides guidelines and information on using payment cards. 

1. **Lost Card Reporting**: Report lost cards immediately to the card company or bank to prevent unauthorized use. If reported promptly, the cardholder can be compensated for unauthorized charges made up to 60 days before the report.

2. **Signing the Card**: Sign the back of your new card immediately. Failure to do so may make you liable for unauthorized charges and limit compensation from the card issuer.

3. **Card Lending**: Do not lend your card to others, as any damages incurred after doing so are not compensable by the card company.

4. **Use of Payment Cards for Public Transportation in Korea**: Public transportation cards, like T-money and Cashbee, are commonly used to pay for bus, train, subway, and highway fares, avoiding the need to carry cash. These cards can be preloaded with cash and are available at subway stations, convenience stores, and kiosks.

Additionally, there's a note on the importance of having insurance in Korea, where some insurances are mandatory and various private insurances are available. It is advisable to compare different insurance plans concerning premiums and coverage before purchasing one. The text discusses the importance of insurance in preparing for unforeseen difficulties such as illness, accidents, or other life challenges. In Korea, there are mandatory insurances provided by the government, as well as various optional ones. It is critical to consider the necessary coverage, premiums, and potential benefits when selecting an insurance policy. Insurance generally involves pooling money from many people to provide financial assistance to those affected by specific incidents. Many insurance policies have long contract periods, and canceling them early might result in losing the premiums paid. Proper understanding of terms and one's financial situation is essential before joining or canceling an insurance plan. Insurance is categorized into social insurance provided by the government and private insurance. The primary social insurances in Korea include National Health Insurance, Employment Insurance, National Pension, and Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance. The text explains the different types of insurance available to residents and workers in Korea. It differentiates between private and public insurance:

1. **Private Insurance**: This type of insurance is provided by private companies and is meant to help individuals prepare for possible future risks. Examples include life, fire, and non-life insurance companies.

   - **National Health Insurance Service**: Covers health care costs.

   - **Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance**: Offers compensation for injuries or deaths that occur at work.
   - **National Pension Plan**: Provides financial support during old age, disability, or upon death.

1. **If You Are Employed**: Submit necessary documents to your employer to enroll in the NHI program.
  
2. **If Your Spouse is Employed and Enrolled in NHI**: If you have little or no income and are registered as a dependent of your spouse, submit relevant forms and documents to a nearby NHI office.

3. **If You Have to Join Community-Based Health Insurance**: If both you and your spouse are self-employed or day laborers and cannot enroll through an employer, you can apply for regional health insurance after residing in Korea for over 180 days. Failure to pay premiums may result in having to cover full medical costs and possible visa extension restrictions. If you already have equivalent medical coverage, you can apply for exclusion from NHI at a nearby NHI office.

Additionally, foreign language services are available in English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Uzbek through specified contact numbers. The text provides information regarding the National Health Insurance (NHI) and Unemployment Insurance in South Korea, especially for foreigners and overseas Koreans. It explains how foreigners can apply for exclusion from the NHI if covered by their own country's laws or insurance. The NHI website offers services in various languages and users can make reservations for consultations at Foreign Service Centers located in different regions, such as Seoul, Ansan, Suwon, Incheon, and Uijeongbu.

For Unemployment Insurance, the text outlines that it provides temporary income support and vocational training to those laid off due to employer difficulties. Foreign workers' enrollment in unemployment insurance may vary based on visa status, with mandatory enrollment for those holding resident (F-2), permanent resident (F-5), or marriage migrant (F-6) visas. Other foreign workers may choose whether or not to enroll. The text provides detailed information about various insurance services available to workers, particularly focused on foreign and marriage immigrants (F-6) visa holders in Korea:

For eligibility inquiries, contact the Ministry of Employment and Labor's call center at ☎1350, pressing extension 4 for foreign language services.

The text also provides tips for using financial services and explains the complexity of private insurance products offered by companies, emphasizing the importance of understanding the characteristics of major insurance products and important considerations when purchasing them. The text discusses financial difficulties that families may face if a family member dies and presents two types of life insurance that can help: whole life insurance and term life insurance. Whole life insurance provides coverage for the insured’s entire lifetime, while term life insurance covers a specified period. The text also touches on medical expense coverage, outlining two types of insurance: indemnity health insurance, which covers actual medical costs but does not allow for overlapping coverage, and fixed benefit insurance, which provides a predetermined payout for specific illnesses and allows for multiple policies. It highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate type of insurance coverage to avoid unnecessary expenses. The text primarily discusses the complexities of purchasing and managing health insurance policies, specifically indemnity health insurance and fixed benefit health insurance. It emphasizes the necessity of aligning insurance plans with one's financial situation due to potential economic burdens from multiple policies. It explains that indemnity health insurance covers the total medical expenses minus deductibles and non-covered items like cosmetic surgery and general checkups but does not cover cosmetic procedures, general health checkups, vaccinations, and nursing expenses. Medical benefit recipients can receive premium discounts by submitting proper documentation.

It provides useful information on how indemnity insurance can cover the cost of treatment-prescribed medicines, including the importance of keeping pharmacy receipts and understanding insurance terms. The comparison between indemnity and fixed benefit health insurance highlights that indemnity insurance covers most illnesses and injuries by terms and conditions, while fixed benefit insurance covers specified illnesses or injuries with benefits disbursed as specified, regardless of multiple plans. Indemnity insurance typically covers 70-80% of medical costs and coordinates benefits to ensure total claims do not exceed actual expenses. The text describes various aspects of different types of insurance, including general insurance policies, online claim services, and specific details about automobile insurance.

1. **General Insurance Policies:**
   - **Coverage:** Insurance companies compensate the amount predetermined in the contract without exceeding the amount actually paid by the policyholder, ensuring proportional coverage.
   - **Pros and Cons:**
     - **Pros:** Wide coverage and high coverage for specified illnesses.
     - **Cons:** Premium is recalculated at each contract renewal. No coverage for illnesses not specified in the contract.

2. **Online Claim for Insurance Money:** 
   - If the insurance amount is less than one million won, it can be easily claimed through the mobile app of the insurance company.

3. **Temporary Payment System for High Medical Bills:**
   - Typically, medical expenses are paid out-of-pocket first and then claimed from insurance.
   - If expenses exceed expectations and immediate payment is not possible, the 'temporary payment system' allows the insurance company to pay a portion of the bill in advance.
   - Under the Medical Care Assistance Act, specific recipients and high-expense cases can submit detailed medical expenses to receive 70% of the expected insurance money upfront, with the remainder paid at final settlement.

4. **Automobile Insurance:**
   - Protects against personal and material damage from automobile accidents.
   - **Types:**
     - **Liability Insurance:** Compulsory coverage for damages caused to others.
     - **Composite Insurance:** Optional additional coverage for broader protection.

The text elaborates on how insurance frameworks operate, including detailed methods for claiming insurance and specific provisions like the temporary payment system for high medical bills. The text provides information on car insurance and pension insurance. 

For car insurance:
- If you only have liability insurance, you must cover any damages exceeding the insurance limits.
- Composite insurance offers broader coverage, including damages to the victims and their vehicles, as well as your own injuries and vehicle. It can also compensate you if the other party lacks insurance.
- Tips to reduce car insurance premiums include driving safely to maintain a good accident history, using special clauses like discounts for low mileage or having a black box installed in the car.

For pension insurance:
- As life expectancy increases, ensuring financial security post-retirement is critical.
- Pension plans are designed to supplement the National Pension and Severance Payment System, providing additional income for retirees.
- These plans require long-term commitment, and it’s crucial to choose one that is affordable to avoid policy termination and loss of premiums already paid.

The text emphasizes the importance of safe driving for reducing car insurance costs and wise financial planning for post-retirement stability. The text provides several tips on how to manage and reduce car insurance premiums, as well as information on variable insurance:

1. **Driver Range**: Limiting the number of people who can drive the insured car can reduce insurance premiums. However, if someone not listed in the policy drives the car and has an accident, the insurance will not cover the damage, so caution is advised.
   
2. **Compliance with Traffic Laws**: Insurance premiums will increase for individuals who habitually violate traffic laws or commit major offences like drunk driving or driving without a license.

3. **Utilization of Driver Experience Recognition System**: If previously insured under a spouse's policy, that driving experience could reduce premiums when first signing up for car insurance.

4. **Preferential Car Insurance for Low-Income Individuals**: Discounts are available for low-income individuals, such as those on basic living support or married couples with a combined annual income of less than 40 million won who own a car that is over five years old.

5. **Variable Insurance**: This is a type of insurance where part of the premium is invested in funds (stocks, bonds), and returns or losses from these investments affect the insurance money and surrender value. This type of insurance can offer high returns but also comes with high risk, so it requires careful consideration. The text provides guidance on subscribing to various insurance products, specifically variable insurances such as annuity, whole life, and universal life insurances, highlighting their respective financial benefits. It emphasizes the importance of checking existing insurance policies to avoid unnecessary duplication of coverage. Additionally, it advises comparing multiple insurance products to find the best fit for one's needs and suggests using online platforms like E-insmarket for this purpose. Another key point is considering one's ability to pay the insurance premiums before signing up. The text discusses the importance of maintaining insurance contracts over a long period and the financial challenges that can arise when dealing with inconsistent income. It emphasizes the need to choose an insurance product that aligns with one's income level to avoid the risk of needing to cancel the policy prematurely, which could result in losses. The text also highlights the obligation to provide truthful and complete information to the insurance company when signing a contract, covering aspects such as medical history, disability, occupation, driving habits, and lifestyle choices. Failure to do so may result in the insurance company refusing to pay out in case of an insurance event. 

Moreover, it underscores the necessity of thoroughly understanding the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and keeping all related documents for future reference. Lastly, it mentions that policyholders have the right to cancel an insurance contract within 15 days of receiving the insurance certificate. The text provides guidance on subscribing to insurance and using insurance services effectively. Here’s a summary:

1. **Cancelling Insurance**: You have the right to cancel your insurance contract within 30 days of receiving the written notice or within three months if you did not receive the terms, explanations, or if you didn't sign the contract by hand.

2. **Using Insurance**: 
   - **Mandatory Health Insurance**: Sign up for mandatory National Health Insurance if you live in Korea for six months or longer. It helps cover medical expenses and is crucial to safeguard against high hospital bills during serious illnesses.
   - **Choosing Insurance Based on Income**: Consider your income when choosing an insurance plan. Guarantee-type insurance is important for future adversities like illness or death, but ensure it’s one you can maintain long-term to avoid losses from early termination.
   - **Avoiding Uninformed Decisions**: Don’t purchase insurance solely based on recommendations from others. Carefully review if the new plan overlaps with existing ones and if it covers your needs to avoid issues like duplicate policies and potential losses from early termination.

Overall, the text emphasizes careful consideration and understanding of insurance terms before committing to avoid financial setbacks. The text provides detailed information on how to exchange money and send money abroad. It is divided into two main sections:

1. **How to Exchange Money**:
   - Understanding exchange rates.
   - Methods to check exchange rates.
   - Steps to exchange money.

2. **How to Send Money Abroad**:
   - Sending money via a bank teller.
   - Using internet banking and mobile banking for international transfers.
   - Utilizing wire transfer services.
   - Sending money through an ATM.
   - Making use of personalized money transfer services from banks.
   - Employing Fintech services for small-sum international transfers.

A conversation between Susan and her colleague discusses concerns about sending money to her family urgently due to her brother's car accident. It touches on various methods of transferring money, legal issues regarding using brokers, and advice from a colleague to use a legitimate bank to save on exchange rates and fees.

A useful tip highlights that there are multiple ways to send money abroad with varying fees and transfer times. It emphasizes the importance of choosing a method that ensures safety, speed, and cost-effectiveness. The text explains how to exchange and send money abroad, focusing on exchange rates. Exchange rates determine how much of one country's currency can be exchanged for another. For example, if the exchange rate is 1,000 Korean won to 1 US dollar, one can exchange 1,000 won for 1 USD. The exchange rate can fluctuate based on economic conditions. When the exchange rate rises, more Korean won is needed to exchange for the same amount of foreign currency, which reduces the real income when sending money abroad. A tip is provided to open a foreign currency account to mitigate losses from exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, examples of different world currencies are provided, including the US dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Philippine peso, European euro, and Vietnamese dong. The text explains the currencies of various countries, including Vietnam (dong), the UK (pound), Cambodia (riel), Thailand (baht), Russia (ruble), and Indonesia (rupiah). It guides on how to check exchange rates, which can be done at a bank or online. The exchange rates shown vary based on the purpose: buying or selling foreign currency in cash, remittance rates, and buying traveler’s checks. It details how to find exchange rates either by visiting a bank, where electronic monitors display the rates, or by searching online via the bank's website or a search portal. The text explains the process of exchanging money into different currencies, specifically focusing on converting Korean won to US dollars and vice versa. It highlights that currency exchange in Korea is usually done through banks. Foreigners can exchange money within certain limits if they provide proof of purchase, such as a certificate of purchased foreign currency or a declaration of means of foreign payment. Without such documents, the exchange limit is up to 10,000 US dollars, necessitating the bank to record the transaction in the passport.

Additionally, to exchange money through a bank teller, foreigners or non-residents need to bring an ID (passport, alien registration card, or resident registration card). If the amount exceeds 10,000 USD, additional proof, like a certificate of purchased foreign currency, is required. The exchange procedure involves taking a ticket, waiting for your turn, filling out an application form with personal details and the amount to be exchanged, and then receiving the foreign currency after making the payment. If no additional documents are needed, the exchange details will be noted on the passport. The text explains the processes of exchanging money and sending money abroad using both in-person banking services and digital banking services. It discusses how banks may offer favorable exchange rates or coupons for loyal customers and advises checking for such offers before visiting a bank. For digital banking services, the text details how to use internet banking or mobile banking to apply for foreign currency exchange, often at better rates than in-person exchanges. It lists the steps to log in to banking websites or apps, select the foreign currency options, and provide necessary information for the transaction. It also notes the importance of claiming exchanged money within a specified period to avoid re-exchange and potential losses due to exchange fees or rate changes. The text provides detailed steps and tips for exchanging currency and sending money abroad. Key points include:

1. To exchange money, you need to:
   - Click on [Request] and enter the password for your digital certificate.
   - Print the receipt for a quicker bank visit.
   - Visit the bank branch with proper ID to pick up the purchased currency.

2. For online exchanges, you can:
   - Check preferential exchange fees and exchangeable currencies for different banks.
   - Visit the Korea Federation of Banks Foreign Exchange Guide website for comparing rates and currencies.

3. To save on exchange fees, consider:
   - Double exchanging (convert Korean won to US Dollars first, then to the local currency abroad) to potentially save fees, especially for countries in Southeast Asia.

4. Overseas remittance involves sending money from Korea to another country, typically for supporting family or other needs. The text provides information on the legal and procedural requirements for sending money abroad, particularly from South Korea. To perform overseas remittances, one must designate a foreign exchange bank and conduct transactions solely through that bank. For amounts up to USD 50,000 per year, no documentation is necessary, but exceeding this limit requires proof, such as pay stubs and previous exchange records. Due to stringent anti-money laundering laws, even smaller sums may require documentation if suspicious activities are detected. 

The remittance process involves a Korean bank sending money to a foreign intermediary, which then forwards it to the recipient’s bank, typically taking 1-3 days and incurring fees. 

An example of illegal activity is given involving Mr. Kim Se Young and his Vietnamese wife, who acted as intermediaries for about 500 workers wishing to send money to Vietnam. They illicitly received 3.6 billion won across 1,400 transactions using fraudulent bank accounts, sending the money in increments of USD 10,000 to accomplices in Vietnam while charging a fee, earning them a total of 108 million won. This unlawful act is known as ""hwanchigi,"" violating foreign exchange laws. The text discusses the methods for sending money abroad from Korea, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unauthorized brokers, known as ""Hwanchigi,"" which violate the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act and can result in fraud. Instead, it is advised to use authorized channels such as bank tellers or internet/mobile banking.

1. **Using a Bank Teller:** This method involves visiting a bank, where you can receive direct instructions from a teller. Although this is a safe method, it comes with higher fees and is limited to banking hours. The remittance fee varies based on the amount but generally ranges from 5,000 to 20,000 won per transaction, plus additional charges like cable fees (approximately 8,000 won), brokerage fees, and recipient bank fees.

2. **Using Internet or Mobile Banking:** This method allows you to send money abroad without visiting a bank. However, you must first visit your bank branch with identification (passport, alien registration card, or resident registration card) to set up the service. At the bank, after taking a ticket and waiting for your turn, you tell the staff about your intent to use internet or mobile banking for remittances and complete the necessary preparatory work under their guidance. Summary of the text ""방법"" (Methods for Overseas Remittance):

1. **Take a Ticket**: Visit a bank with identification (passport, alien registration card) and wait for service. Foreigners must carry their passports.
2. **Fill Out an Application Form**: Provide remittance details in English, including sender information, recipient’s name, account number, and recipient bank’s name and address.
3. **Pay the Amount and Fees**: Pay the remittance amount, service fee, cable charge, and brokerage fee.
4. **Keep Transaction Records**: Retain the remittance document and receipt for proof in case of issues.

Before visiting the bank, check the required documents and information. For remittances, common documents include a passport and an application form. Additional documents may be required for foreign workers, especially for specific scenarios like annual remittances exceeding USD 50,000. The text provides a detailed guide on international remittance, including necessary information and steps for sending money abroad.

### Information Required for Remittance:
1. **Sender's Information:** Name, address, phone number (including area code).
2. **Recipient’s Information:** Name, address, phone number (including area code).

To ensure a successful overseas remittance, accurate information must be entered. It typically takes 1-3 days for the transfer to complete. The recipient’s account number, bank details, branch, and country must be correct to avoid delays. Here’s a step-by-step guide for sending money via internet banking:

The procedure is similar to internet banking, apart from the app installation and login. Banks have introduced simple login methods like patterns and PINs, making mobile banking increasingly popular due to its convenience.

Lastly, there is a tip suggesting that users compare and check remittance fees for different banks. Here's the summary of the text provided:

To minimize remittance fees, compare fees across different banks and choose the bank with the lowest fees for foreign exchange transactions. You can open a payroll account with this bank for additional benefits. The Korea Federation of Banks website (kfb.or.kr) offers a portal where you can compare these fees.

For mobile banking remittances, follow these steps:

1. **Running the App**: Log in to your banking app.
2. **Filling Out the Application Form**:
   - Check transfer details, select the reason for remittance, choose the currency and the account for withdrawal, and designate who will pay the remittance fee.
3. **Entering Sender and Recipient Information**:
   - Input sender details (name, phone, email).
   - Input recipient details (name, account number, address, phone).
   - Provide the recipient’s bank code or select the bank’s name, branch, and destination country if the code is unknown.

These procedures ensure efficient and cost-effective remittance transactions. The text provides a guide on sending money internationally using wire transfer services and mobile banking. The process involves selecting the bank, branch, and country, entering a certificate password, and confirming the transaction. Major wire transfer service providers like Western Union and MoneyGram allow quick money transfers, even within 10 minutes. Many domestic banks facilitate these services, with specific banks listed for both Western Union and MoneyGram.

Key points to consider include comparing service fees and exchange rates as wire transfer services often have higher fees and less favorable rates compared to banks. It is also important to ensure the availability of these services in the recipient's location before proceeding. The procedure involves visiting a participating bank, filling out an English application form, and showing identification alongside the application and remittance amount. The text provides an overview of the procedures for sending money abroad both through a bank and via an ATM. 

1. **Bank Remittance Process**:
   - **Required Documents**: Submit the application form, remittance amount, and identification (passport or alien registration card).
   - **Approval and Receipt**: Once processed, receive a remittance approval number and a receipt.

2. **ATM Remittance Service**:
   - **Pre-Application Requirement**: Apply in advance for ATM remittance service.
   - **Sending Money**:
     - Visit a bank to register the recipient’s bank information.
     - Use the ATM to select either the pre-registered recipient information or the most recent remittance record.

Additionally, the document hints at an upcoming section on personalized money transfer services offered by traditional banks. The text discusses the traditional and modern methods of remitting money abroad. Historically, traditional banks prioritized the safe transfer of funds to recipients. However, personalized money transfer services now aim at meeting diverse customer needs, such as automatic remittance for regular transfers to family or local currency transfers for recipients abroad.

Recently, banks have introduced fintech-based accountless remittance services that enable recipients without bank accounts to receive money. Additionally, these services offer low-fee, fast, and safe transfers to over 200 countries. Each bank has different service names, application procedures, and available countries, so customers should consult their banks before using such services.

The text also covers small-sum money transfer services offered by fintech companies. These services provide 24-hour online remittance with potentially lower fees (up to 90% cheaper than banks) and quick transfers. Users can transfer less than USD 5,000 per transaction and up to USD 50,000 per year. However, different service providers may have varying remittance methods and recipient verification processes, so users should ensure accurate transfers to avoid errors. Misdirected transfers can frequently occur, making it challenging to retrieve the wrongly sent money. Hence, it's essential to input and double-check all necessary information for overseas remittances meticulously. Banks provide varied special remittance services, and these include automatic remittance, account-free remittance, and remittance in double/local currency. Examples include one-stop services from Shinhan Bank, regular overseas remittance services from Woori Bank, and various other offerings from banks like Kookmin, Jeonbuk, and Gwangju. For detailed information, customers should contact the respective banks. The text provides an overview of real-time money transfer services offered by various Korean banks.

The text discusses the precautions and steps for foreign workers to safely send money abroad using Fintech small-sum money transfer services. It highlights the potential risk of fraud from illegal companies offering low fees and advises verifying whether a company is officially registered through the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) website, FINE (fine.fss.or.kr).

Here are the steps summarized:
1. Verify the company's registration on FINE.
2. Install the relevant app.
3. Sign up using required documents like ID and possibly a bank account number.

   - Designate a primary bank for remittances to get better rates and additional benefits.
   - Fintech Small-sum Money Transfer Services offer lower fees, but are limited to USD 5,000 per transaction and USD 50,000 per year. The text describes the regulations and procedures for foreign remittance and how to prevent financial fraud. For remittances, up to US$50,000 can be sent annually without additional documentation after registering with a designated foreign exchange bank and providing customer information. For amounts exceeding US$50,000, proof of income, such as a paystub, is required.

The text concludes with an example dialogue illustrating a common scam call, where a scammer pretends to be an investigator from the prosecutor's office to extract personal information under the guise of security measures. The text describes a typical scenario of a voice phishing scam where a scammer convinces Susan to enter her financial information on a fake website designed to resemble a government site. Susan, deceived by the scam, provides her personal identification, account password, and security card number, and even shares a verification code received on her phone. The scammers then hijack 10 million won (Korean currency) by reissuing a digital certificate in her name, withdrawing the money, and obtaining card loans.

Useful tips are provided to prevent such frauds, stressing that calls asking for personal information from supposed government agencies are definite scams. Foreign residents are particularly warned as they can be easy targets. It is crucial never to share ID numbers, bank account details, or PINs over the phone. The text also highlights the rapid increase in voice phishing cases in Korea, with about 198 daily incidents reported as of 2019, causing significant financial damage. The text discusses the reduction in voice phishing damages due to continuous prevention efforts and restrictions on fraudulent organizations' activities because of COVID-19. However, foreign residents in Korea are particularly vulnerable to financial scams due to their limited financial knowledge. The document outlines various financial scam types and prevention methods, with a focus on phishing, a prominent type of financial fraud. 

Phishing uses telecommunication means to deceive individuals into providing personal information. Specifically, ""voice phishing"" involves fraudulent phone calls to steal data. This type of scam initially targeted individuals with limited financial knowledge but has since evolved to affect people of all ages and occupations. Scammers often use pre-obtained personal information or social issues like hacking accidents and vaccinations to deceive individuals. The text emphasizes the need for vigilance to avoid becoming a victim of these scams. The text provides an overview of voice phishing scams, emphasizing the need for great caution to avoid falling victim. It details some common characteristics of these scams, including:

1. **Impersonation:** Scammers mimic government organizations and financial institutions.
2. **Psychological Pressure:** They use false claims to create anxiety, such as saying your personal information has been stolen or that you are involved in a crime.
3. **Caller ID Manipulation:** They manipulate caller IDs to appear as if they are calling from legitimate organizations.
4. **Fluent Korean:** Modern scammers use fluent Korean, unlike earlier scams.
5. **Direct Withdrawal/Transfer:** Scammers obtain victims’ financial information to directly withdraw or transfer money.
6. **Illegally Acquired Bank Accounts:** They use bank accounts obtained through false pretenses like job offers or loans for fraudulent activities.

The text also provides prevention tips:

1. **Never Share Personal Information:** Do not share your account numbers, credit card information, or internet banking details over the phone or online if asked.
2. **Beware of ATM Requests:** Scammers often ask victims to use ATMs for fake refunds or account ""safety measures."" Never follow such instructions.

In summary, the text outlines how to identify and prevent voice phishing scams by recognizing common scam tactics and avoiding sharing personal or financial information. The text provides guidance on preventing financial fraud, particularly targeting Chinese and Vietnamese workers in Korea. It discusses several cases where scammers called these workers under the pretense that their families were in an emergency, and provides practical steps to avoid falling victim to such scams. Key advice includes:

1. Keeping the contact information of your child's friends and teachers to verify any kidnapping claims.
2. Confirming the authenticity of calls, texts, or messages by directly contacting the institution involved.
3. Promptly requesting a payment suspension if victimized by voice phishing by calling relevant authorities or financial institutions.
4. Being aware that caller IDs can be manipulated, even if using telebanking systems with pre-designated numbers.

The overall message emphasizes caution and verification before taking any financial actions in response to unsolicited communications. The text provides information on preventing financial fraud, specifically targeting voice phishing scams. It offers advice for using financial services safely and avoiding scams. A notable initiative is the ""Voice Phishing Keeper"" menu on the Financial Supervisory Service's website, where users can listen to recorded scammer voices and report phishing calls. As of December 2021, multiple scammer voices have been registered and reported.

Additionally, it warns about unknowingly participating in voice phishing schemes through job advertisements found on the internet or SNS. It is illegal to withdraw or remit cash using someone else's card or passbook. Foreigners unfamiliar with Korean laws have been arrested and deported for such activities. The text emphasizes the importance of being cautious to avoid getting entangled in voice phishing crimes. The text describes two incidents of individuals unknowingly becoming involved in financial scams. In the first instance, an individual withdrew cash using payment cards stored in an unmanned delivery box, not realizing that the orders came from a voice phishing criminal organization. The cash withdrawn turned out to be money stolen through voice phishing. In the second case, Ms. B found a part-time job on social media that required her to transfer money deposited in her account overseas. The next day, her bank account was suspended, and her contact on the social media platform had disappeared.

The text further explains ""messenger phishing,"" where scammers hack people's online messenger IDs and passwords to send urgent requests for money to their contacts, pretending to be in need of emergency funds. For instance, scammers may send fake emergency notices posing as financial companies to lure victims into providing personal information, which is then used to steal money or take out loans in the victims' names. Additionally, they may impersonate family members, such as sending a message saying ""Mom, this is your daughter,"" to trick individuals into sending money or sharing personal information. The text describes methods of financial fraud where scammers impersonate a victim's child via text messages to urgently request money or personal information (ID card or credit card picture). They use this information to open bank accounts and get loans in the victim's name. To prevent such scams, the text advises not to respond to requests for money or personal information from messages posing as friends or family, especially if they claim their phone is lost or broken. It also suggests verifying the sender by phone, avoiding suspicious app installations or URL clicks, rejecting requests for ID or money for credit rating upgrades, and confirming any unknown credit card charges directly with the credit card company. Suspicious messages should be deleted immediately without being opened.

Additionally, it briefly touches on financial fraud involving the internet and smartphones, emphasizing pharming and smishing, where devices are compromised by malicious code. The text discusses phishing and financial scams involving fake internet banking sites, where users are tricked into providing personal financial information like IDs, passwords, and security card numbers. It emphasizes that legitimate financial institutions never ask for such information and advises users never to provide it. Protective measures include using one-time passwords (OTPs), avoiding suspicious emails and files, regularly changing passwords, and enrolling in fraud prevention services offered by banks. It also describes smishing, a technique combining SMS and phishing to steal personal information via malicious links in text messages. An example case is provided where a woman was deceived into entering her banking details on a fake website after clicking on a security check popup. A person received a message asking for her personal financial information. After complying, all the money in her bank account was stolen within an hour.

To prevent electronic financial fraud, you can utilize additional security check services such as User Terminal Designation Service and Additional Security Check Service. With the User Terminal Designation Service, you can register up to five devices for financial transactions without additional security checks. The Additional Security Check Service requires identity verification for certain activities, such as reissuing certificates or transferring large sums of money.

These services are available to all individual customers who use internet banking and can be activated through their primary bank.

Smishing is a type of financial scam where malicious text messages are used to steal personal and micropayment information stored on mobile phones. The messages often impersonate wedding invitations, birthday celebrations, free coupons, and delivery notifications, among others. The text provides information about ""smishing,"" a type of phishing that uses text messages to trick recipients into clicking on malicious links. These messages often appear as legitimate notifications such as wedding or birthday invitations, delivery notices, free coupons, or official communications like police summons, traffic citations, or health examination offers. If a message appears suspicious, it is advised not to click on any links or phone numbers.

To prevent smishing, the text suggests the following tips:
1. Do not click on links or numbers in text messages with unverified sources, especially those related to deliveries, holiday greetings, and tickets.
2. Enhance smartphone security settings to prevent unauthorized app installations. Download apps only from official app stores like Google Play or Apple Store.
3. Regularly install and update antivirus programs.
4. Never respond to requests for personal or financial information under the guise of identity verification, disaster subsidies, or vaccine reservations.
5. If you do not use micropayment services on your smartphone, contact your telecom provider to block these services.

An example is given where an individual received a fake text message invitation, resulting in the installation of a malicious application and a loss of 260,000 won due to unauthorized microtransactions.

The text also provides general advice on preventing financial fraud and highlights the importance of knowing where to seek help if one becomes a victim. The text provides information on what to do if you suspect you've been scammed, particularly concerning financial fraud. It includes specific steps such as:

1. Requesting the suspension of payment activities from both your account and the account to which money was sent. Call center numbers for card companies can be found in Reference 3 (p. 171).

2. Contacting various authorities for assistance:
   - Financial Supervisory Service (☎1332) for consulting on loss or refunds.
   - National Police Agency (☎112) to report financial scams and request suspension of payment activities.
   - Korea Internet and Security Agency (☎118) for reporting phishing sites, spam calls, and messages.
   - Korea Legal Aid Corporation (☎132) for information on civil litigation procedures for refund of phishing fraud damages.

The text also highlights preventive measures and characteristics of loan fraud, where scammers impersonate employees of well-known financial companies, promoting loans via flyers, calls, and messages without face-to-face contact. They ask for brokerage fees and disappear after receiving payments. Some common tactics include:
- Sending random text messages offering low-interest loans and collecting personal information during follow-up calls.
- Impersonating banks or the government.

For additional resources, the text refers to the Financial Supervisory Service Voice Phishing Keeper website. Scammers deceive individuals by pretending they can convert high-interest loans into low-interest or government-supported loans for ordinary people. They then swindle money by requiring victims to send payments to an illegally acquired bank account, allegedly as fees for repaying the high-interest loan. Scammers also demand various fees, such as guarantee and data processing fees, claiming they are necessary for securing loans or deleting bad credit history. They ask for personal information, including phone numbers, photocopies of bankbooks, and check card numbers, which can then be exploited in financial scams. To prevent loan fraud, individuals should block scam calls and messages, avoid paying upfront fees, and never share personal details or financial information with others.

For instance, a 50-year-old man named Mr. K was contacted by a scammer impersonating a bank employee, promising to switch his high-interest loan to a low-interest one. Following the scammer's instructions, Mr. K took out a high-interest loan of 13.5 million won and transferred it to a specified account, falling victim to the fraud. The text discusses financial fraud involving the use of illegally obtained bank accounts, often referred to as ""borrowed-name accounts"" (대포통장 in Korean). It explains that these accounts are opened under a third person's name but used by someone else, primarily for receiving funds from frauds like voice phishing, since they evade tracking by authorities.

Key points include:
1. **Characteristics and Risks**: Illegally obtained accounts are commonly used in fraud schemes. People should be cautious to prevent their accounts from being misused.
2. **Consequences for Account Holders**: If someone's account is used in a scam, they might face payment suspensions, restrictions on electronic banking, and a one-year prohibition on opening new accounts. Those involved in transferring or renting out accounts might face up to five years in prison and fines up to 30 million won, and criminal charges may apply.
3. **Prohibited Actions**: The transfer and lending of bank accounts, check cards, and cash cards is illegal.
4. **Common Fraud Methods**: Scammers often lure people into lending their accounts by promising short-term high profits via text messages or social media.

In a specific example, an individual named 기범 (Ki-beom) follows instructions under the promise of switching to a low-interest loan, but the scammer withdraws 13.5 million won and disappears. The text discusses various methods scammers use to commit financial fraud. Scammers often induce people to lend their bank accounts under the pretense of purchasing or currency exchange via social media and job sites. They may ask individuals to provide personal information and use these accounts for illegal transactions such as transferring voice phishing victims' funds. Scammers also pretend to offer loans, prompting victims to make transactions to improve their credit rating, unwittingly involving them in fraudulent activities. Another tactic is scammers claiming that money was mistakenly transferred and requesting a re-transfer. An example is provided where Mr. K, a man in his 20s, was duped into a part-time job as a purchasing agent, leading to his account being used for illegal activities. This caused him to be registered as the holder of a fraudulent account. The text discusses measures to prevent financial fraud, particularly focusing on voice phishing and the misuse of bank accounts. It outlines scenarios where victims are manipulated into retransferring or withdrawing money. Preventive guidelines include refusing to lend or transfer bank accounts, rejecting transactions with unknown funds, denying requests for personal information or account numbers before starting a job, and using the Financial Supervisory Service’s Personal Information Exposure Accident Prevention System if personal information is suspected to be leaked. Additionally, it touches on insurance fraud, highlighting the importance of disclosing critical details when purchasing insurance and warning against deceptive practices like falsifying accident claims. The text discusses insurance fraud and its common characteristics. It describes how fraud can be complex and diverse, often involving serious crimes like murder and arson to obtain insurance money. Fraudulent activities are commonly conducted by multiple accomplices to disguise accidents and evade charges. The crime is increasingly organized and involves professional groups such as criminal organizations, medical facilities, repair shops, and taxi drivers, with tactics including causing traffic accidents to claim insurance money.

The text outlines two main types of insurance fraud:
1. **False diagnosis and hospitalization** in collusion with brokers and hospital officials, involving fake disease codes to claim large insurance payouts without genuine hospitalization.
2. **Intentional automobile crashes** involving groups using vehicles to cause accidents with target vehicles that violate traffic laws, subsequently exaggerating injuries or damage to claim insurance money. The text discusses various forms of insurance fraud and how to prevent them. It identifies specific fraudulent activities, including false claims regarding accident details or intentional accidents caused by delivery workers using two-wheeled vehicles. It also details preventive measures, advising individuals to reject suspiciously high wage offers that involve illegal activity, avoid misrepresenting accident information to insurance companies, and report suspected insurance fraud to the appropriate authorities such as the Financial Supervisory Service. An example of insurance fraud is provided, where a naturalized Korean received insurance money by not disclosing their medical history. The text emphasizes the importance of fulfilling disclosure duties. It concludes with a reminder to report insurance fraud to the Insurance Fraud Reporting Center, operated by the Financial Supervisory Service and insurance companies. The text provides information on how to report insurance fraud in South Korea, listing various hotlines and websites for life insurance and non-life insurance companies. It emphasizes the importance of being aware of financial scams, especially as incidents involving smartphones and the internet increase. Detailed contact information for both types of insurance companies is provided, including names, call center numbers, and websites for companies like Hanwha Life, Samsung Life, and others. Additionally, it mentions the role of the Financial Supervisory Service and their website in combating insurance fraud. The text provides advice on avoiding financial scams, particularly for immigrants and foreign workers who may be unfamiliar with such tactics. 

1. Understand the types of financial scams: With the widespread use of smartphones and the internet, scams are becoming more sophisticated, making it important for those unfamiliar with local customs to stay informed.
2. Do not disclose personal information: Never share personal information with anyone, especially those claiming to be from public organizations, phone carriers, or banks. This is particularly important for foreign job seekers who are often targeted by scammers.
3. Know who to contact in an emergency: If you fall victim to a scam, contact the police (☎112) or your financial company immediately to halt any payments. You can also reach out to the Financial Supervisory Service (☎1332) for assistance with loss recovery.
4. It is illegal to lend your bankbook: Lending or selling your bankbook is illegal and often requested by criminals. Doing so can lead to civil and criminal penalties, and disadvantages in financial transactions.
5. Be wary of suspicious offers: Reject any offers that guarantee high wages but involve illegal activities, such as issuing false diagnoses or causing intentional car accidents. 

The emphasized points are to stay informed, protect personal information, and be cautious of too-good-to-be-true offers.
